            "paraphrased_content": "But for other podcasts, individual episode art is a vital part of their branding.Producing new art for every episode takes additional time and labor, and not every podcast finds it necessary.There have been some rumblings of legislative movement in the UK and US.That includes the possibility that a bill known as the Open Apps Markets Act in the US (which would require Apple and Google to allow competing app stores) may come before a more sympathetic House panel, according to Politico Pro.\u201cApple has continued to enjoy \u2014 and profit from \u2014 the status quo while everything else in the world has seemingly advanced forward.Most YouTube-focused podcasters think of episode art as a vital part of their publication process rather than just an option.Prior to Apple Podcasts, iTunes had the ability for podcasters to include episode art.\u201cIt always ended up being too expensive and not worth the return on investment,\u201d wrote Goldman in a direct message to Hot Pod.Podcasts with highly visual subject matter, such as those that focus on the arts, may find it easier to come up with new material for every episode.The Swedish company has accused Apple of \u201cchoking competition\u201d through its 30 percent tax on in-app transactions, which it says has specifically harmed its new audiobooks business.This thumbnail will also show up as episode art where the podcast\u2019s audio version is available, such as on Spotify and (now) Apple Podcasts.According to Apple\u2019s guidelines, creators are advised to avoid repeating the episode\u2019s title in their episode art, keep the \u201cvisual branding\u201d distinct from the show and channel art, and use a colorful background that allows for white UI text to be visible.While Jenkins acknowledged that \u201cthere has been some momentum\u201d in the European Union, more progress was needed worldwide.This is\u00a0Hot Pod,\u00a0The Verge\u2019s newsletter about podcasting and the audio industry.Spotify\u2019s years-long battle against Apple and time spent lobbying multiple governments have led to one big victory: the EU\u2019s tough new Digital Markets Act regulation, which classifies Apple as a gatekeeper, would require the company to include third-party app stores.Alex Goldman, a former host of Reply All, recalled that while the podcast occasionally experimented with custom art, it \u201cnever seemed all that useful\u201d unless it appeared as a part of an iTunes banner, for example.For an even more visually oriented experience, podcasters can also attach chapter-specific art, which will be displayed at specific points throughout each episode.First off, I\u2019ll take a look at Spotify\u2019s chief public affairs officer\u2019s lengthy new blog post about Apple\u2019s App Store policies.The EU narrowed an investigation into Apple back in February, essentially dropping charges related to Apple\u2019s in-app payment system.But depending on how the DMA is enforced (which goes into effect in May 2024), Apple\u2019s in-app payment policy may face another roadblock.Finally, Semafor\u2019s Max Tani posted on X (formerly Twitter) that Sony Music is laying off employees in its global podcast division.Before I hit the news, a couple of new developments.One good example is Vulture and Vox Media Podcast Network\u2019s Switched on Pop, a pop music podcast that features custom illustrations of the musicians or music discussed in each episode, from SZA to Taylor Swift to the music behind the movie Barbie.Ragland compared a podcast\u2019s episode art to YouTube thumbnails.Apple declined to provide a comment that could be attributed to a named spokesperson.Apple Podcasts will finally allow for episode art with iOS 17\n\nIndividual episode art will now be supported on Apple Podcasts as a part of the iOS 17 update.The episode art will appear throughout Apple Podcasts, including \u201cNow Playing,\u201d \u201cQueue,\u201d your device\u2019s lock screen show pages, and \u201cUp Next.\u201d Any time you send a link to an individual podcast episode on iMessage, email, or share it on social media, the episode art will be displayed in the link previews.But the possibility of the bill\u2019s passage by both houses of Congress still appears to be slim.Members will pay $4.99 per month for a number of perks, including ad-free episodes of every podcast in the Freakonomics Radio Network.Also, Apple\u2019s iOS 17 will bring episode art to Apple Podcasts.For shows that do take the trouble to create individual episode art, an eye-catching image is just one more bit of information that can help with podcast discoverability \u2014\u00a0along with show descriptions, episode titles, show notes, and other details.Some even hire dedicated thumbnail artists and devote time to A/B testing of thumbnails.While this is a nice development for podcasts that already create episode art (Spotify, YouTube, and a number of other podcast players already support it), the update likely won\u2019t mean much for podcasts that have opted out of episode art entirely.Spotify fires some more shots at Apple for App Store policies\n\nSpotify\u2019s chief public affairs officer, Dustee Jenkins, provided a status update on the streaming service\u2019s years-long fight for global regulatory action against Apple\u2019s restrictive App Store policies \u2014 which began back in 2018.Although images like show art and episode art aren\u2019t searchable on podcast players, they can draw a listener\u2019s eyeballs or even complement the episode itself.Nathan Ragland, the host of the Post Modern Art Podcast (which features interviews with illustrators, animators, and other visual artists), will include a custom thumbnail for each guest, often by the artists themselves.Likewise, if the episode art shows off something or someone a person wants to know more of, they may be more inclined to listen in,\u201d he wrote in a message to Hot Pod.Episode art is, of course, a different game on YouTube, where a decent thumbnail can wrack up thousands of views.Apple\u2019s guidelines for podcast art didn\u2019t make life easier for some creators.Ragland either offers to commission the thumbnail from the guest or (if they don\u2019t have the time) will commission another artist to produce it.Other podcasts will deploy it on a case-by-case basis or to distinguish special episodes \u2014 for example, The Vergecast recently rolled out new episode art for its mini-series on AI.Happy Tuesday!Got a super-packed issue of Hot Pod today for everyone.\u201cSometimes the thumbnail grabs the audience\u2019s attention and makes the person want to watch.For example, most of the podcasts in the Vox Media Podcast Network (disclosure: Hot Pod is part of Vox Media), such as Today, Explained, The Weeds, This is Love, and others, do not include individual episode art.Just this summer, a US appeals court ruled in Apple\u2019s favor in the Epic lawsuit contesting those restrictions \u2014\u00a0with the caveat that developers should be allowed to link to external payment options.The Reply All team would submit art to Apple, only to get rejected \u2014\u00a0sometimes even multiple times.First off, Freakonomics Radio unveiled a new premium subscription today called Freakonomics Radio Plus.In the absence of meaningful government action, Apple gets a free pass to do whatever it pleases and consumers are paying the price,\u201d wrote Jenkins.Creating custom art for individual episodes can be a confusing process \u2014\u00a0especially since not all hosts and players followed the same standard.While Spotify, Castbox, and Podcast Addict support episode art through a podcast\u2019s RSS feed, other players like Pocket Casts and Overcast will only support it if it\u2019s embedded in an MP3 file.Creators can view Apple Podcasts\u2019 templates for both episode art and chapter-specific art here.This includes Freakonomics Radio, No Stupid Questions, People I (Mostly) Admire, The Economics of Everyday Things, and The Freakonomics Radio Book Club.Podcasters who attach a unique image to each episode via their podcast\u2019s RSS feed will see it displayed on Apple\u2019s podcast player.What will that mean for podcasters?Sign up\u00a0here\u00a0for more.",

Google amid a dispute over how files should be made available online, according to reporter Leah Nylen of Bloomberg.Google, Apple, and others have argued that the trial threatens to expose sensitive financial information as the Justice Department makes its case that Google established an unlawful monopoly in the search engine business.The page formerly hosting exhibits from the trial is currently offline, although a snapshot from last week remains available via the Internet Archive.Nylen, reporting from the courtroom, said that Judge Amit Mehta will make a decision in the morning on future online access to exhibits.The FTC\u2019s recent court battle with Microsoft, for instance, led to details leaking from incomplete redactions as well as a trove of apparently mistakenly uploaded documents that revealed internal plans for a new Xbox console earlier this week.And US v. Google has been a constant tug-of-war over public access to what might be one of the most consequential antitrust trials of the decade.(The Verge has linked to the now-removed page in previous trial coverage.)The Big Tech On Trial newsletter reported more details of the exchange, which apparently occurred during an exchange between the Justice Department and Google over whether an exhibit could be submitted as evidence.Google declined to comment on the record about the dispute, and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Big Tech On Trial reports that Mehta said he isn\u2019t necessarily opposed to the documents being posted and that the Justice Department offered to notify Google of what it planned to post in advance, potentially averting future conflict.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Nvidia knows this because it was the one that created the world's first GPU, the Nvidia GeForce 256, back in 1999.We've come full circle then, and graphics processors are so overwhelmed with the workloads being assigned to them that they cannot keep up and we can't squeeze more performance out of the same-sized silicon.Nvidia may be joining AMD and Intel in developing a multi-chiplet architecture for its next generation of GPUs, and could reap major gains in terms of performance.Nvidia is the last of the big three chipmakers that still uses a single slice of silicon for the processors inside its best graphics cards, so it's something of a welcome surprise that rumors have begun circulating that the company will finally move to the more adaptable multi-chiplet module (MCM) design with its next-generation Nvidia Blackwell architecture.The work around was to pass all but the most basic graphics processing work off to a second processor, the GPU, which was specially designed for this task and which went on to power the modern era of computer graphics.The chiplets in an MCM design, when interconnected into a single processor, promises significantly faster performance over a monolithic slab of silicon.It's time then to break up geometry, rasterization, ray tracing, machine learning, and other GPU workloads into different mini-processors that can be specifically engineered to perform those tasks faster and more efficiently than we're currently doing.For 50 years, that had been the case, but as we now measure the size of transistors relative to the diameter of individual atoms in the silicon, cutting a transistor's size in half just isn't possible anymore.But consumers and industry have become used to faster computers every couple of years, and so no one really wants to hear that the party is over.As Tom's Hardware explains, a single silicon chip is constrained by the physical dimensions of the equipment used to fabricate it.We've already been doing this for more than a decade, as Nvidia well knows.The report comes from well-known hardware leaker @kopite7kimi on X, who said that Nvidia's commercial-grade GB100 GPU will feature MCM for the first time.After the dramas of GA100 and GH100, it seems that GB100 is finally going to use MCM.September 18, 2023See moreThe Nvidia Blackwell architecture is expected to power both Nvidia's next-gen commercial GPU products, which are used by data centers and industial-scale users, as well as its consumer graphics cards, the Nvidia RTX 5000 series.Even though both will use the Blackwell architecture, however, it's unclear at the moment if the MCM shift will also extend to the Nvidia 5000 series graphics cards.Nvidia's chief competitor, AMD, is already doing this and it's seen very positive results so far.If you're a chip maker looking to keep selling more processors, you have to find another way to deliver those performance gains the market expects, Moore's Law be damned.The answer to this is using multiple chips in conjunction with one another to achieve those performance targets.If you can produce two or more chiplets that are smaller, but use special ties called interconnects to link them together so they act as a single unit, you can effectively build a larger chip than the fabrication process can supprt and dramatically improve performance.With an MCM design for its GPUs, Nvidia might be able to deliver the kinds of gains across its entire portfolio of Nvidia 5000 series cards that many were hoping to see with the 4000 series but which Nvidia wasn't able to deliver consistently.If it does, though, it could provide the transformational performance for Nvidia's next graphics card generation that was often lacking in some of its more recent RTX 4000-series cards.Obviously, this is still very speculative and based on rumors, but there's a reason why both AMD and Intel have made the switch to MCM in their GPUs and CPUs, and Nvidia would be very smart to follow suit, or risk getting left behind.Make the move to MCM, Nvidia, it's the only way forward(Image credit: Nvidia)The problem chip makers have been having for years now has been the end of Moore's Law, the famous prediction by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that transistor density on a chip would double roughly every two years.Currently, the process Nvidia uses can only produce a 26mm by 33mm (858mm\u00b2) pieces of silicon at most, and Nvidia's commercial-grade GPUs are already bumping right up against that maximum size.And since it's become exponentially more difficult for even the best processors to further shrink the size of a transistor, the electronic switch inside a chip that produces a computer's logic functionality, the only way to increase the number of transistors in your GPU to increase performance is to make the chip larger than the physical manufacturing process will allow.There was a time when there was no such thing as a graphics processor, there was just the main CPU which was expected to handle graphics as well as every other operation.As graphics became more advanced though, this so heavily taxed the CPU that something had to be done before computing 3D scenes either ate up 99.9% of the CPU's clock cycles, or the limits of the CPU itself ground computer graphics progress to a halt.That's where the chiplets come in.And while the first few attempts to get MCM engineering right might not be the revolution that the first GPU was when it landed over 20 years ago, future attempts will get us to where we want\u2014and Nvidia needs\u2014to be, so Nvidia should probably get to work on that.",

Microsoft\n\nObviously, it\u2019s taking the Sony DualSense\u2019s \u201cprecision haptic feedback.\u201d\n\nRight, here\u2019s hoping!Google Stadia pioneered direct-to-cloud by connecting the controller directly to your home Wi-Fi, and it let me seamlessly move between playing a game on my PC, TV, and phone.You might want to keep yours from being bricked, BTW.Former Polygon editor-in-chief (and current publisher) Chris Grant tells me Xbox One controllers seemed to last forever if you had a Microsoft Kinect set up \u2014 since the camera handled that presence detection role.(In an earlier version of this story, I also credited 8BitDo with making a rechargeable battery that can fit in the AA pocket, but Xbox has been selling an optional aftermarket one for a while.",

there\u2019s very little doing.The user interface on Amazon smart displays is about showing; there\u2019s very little doing\n\nThat last part is the key.While smart displays seemed like the solution for Amazon (which wanted to move away from a smart home that\u2019s run from your phone, seeing as it\u2019s the only major smart home ecosystem that doesn\u2019t make one), they don\u2019t provide enough value.Yes, you can navigate three menus down on a Fire TV-enabled television and turn a smart light off, and your Apple TV or Google Chromecast will let you view a security camera livestream if you know the exact incantation to summon it.Almost everyone has a TV.My 65-inch TV can clearly fit more than eight icons on the screen... .Here\u2019s hoping we see a vision of that future at tomorrow\u2019s Amazon event.But to date, the relationship between the smart TV and the smart home has been more parasitic than symbiotic.Chastened by layoffs, huge losses, and the departure of longtime commander-in-chief Dave Limp, the future has been looking bleak for Amazon\u2019s devices and services division.The Amazon Fire TV Cube is already halfway to this smart home hub vision.Image: Amazon\n\nYet, ultimately, what\u2019s holding the TV back as a smart home interface is software.They\u2019re not very good smart home controllers, and their equally capable smart speaker siblings sound better and cost less.Amazon\u2019s Smart Home Dashboard for Fire TV (launched in 2021) is usable but in need of a complete overhaul.(Believe me, I\u2019ve tried).In this world, we wouldn\u2019t need smart displays littered all over our houses or a powerful, intuitive interface in our living room.Amazon has its big fall devices event tomorrow.A Fire TV Cube-style streaming device / smart speaker combined with a powerful smart home hub channeled through your house\u2019s largest \u201csmart display\u201d could be a compelling package \u2014 and one that would allow Amazon\u2019s assistant to flex whatever AI superpowers the company has planned.Crucially, this wouldn\u2019t be something just for the early adopters.But make it all really easy to use from your TV, and that\u2019s a whole other ball game.A hybrid Echo speaker and Fire TV, it\u2019s the only TV streaming box with hands-free voice control, allowing you to turn on your living room lights from your TV without having to press a button.People are prepared to spend money on a device for streaming TV shows and movies.The relationship between the smart TV and the smart home is more parasitic than symbiotic\n\nThat could be about to change.Samsung is probably the closest with its SmartThings interface, but it\u2019s unwieldy to navigate compared to a smartphone or tablet.Google\u2019s Chromecast also lets you call up live camera views on your TV; although, there\u2019s no UI for this; it\u2019s all voice control.The Fire TV Smart Home Dashboard doesn\u2019t exactly take advantage of its available real estate.One way to do that is for Amazon to focus less on a smattering of smart displays and more on that giant smart display in our living room: the TV.With rumors that Limp\u2019s successor will be none other than Microsoft\u2019s hardware whisperer Panos Panay, we can hope for some shiny new surfaces for Alexa in the coming years.Yes, there\u2019ll probably be new Kindles; personally, I\u2019d like to see a new smart speaker (the flagship Echo fourth-gen is very long in the tooth), and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see some minor Fire TV Stick upgrades.With 90 percent of Alexa routines having no interaction by the customer, the leap doesn\u2019t seem as far-fetched as it once was, especially with the new supercharged AI.But instead of also hoisting a bunch of new random gadgets at us that maybe make it to the next holiday buying season (I\u2019m looking at you, Halo Rise), I\u2019m hoping this event will be a big reset and refocus moment for Amazon\u2019s hardware division.It\u2019s a harder sell to convince a non-techie family member that it\u2019s worth handing over $130 or so for an Echo Show 8 that can (sometimes) show you your video doorbell.As for Google\u2026 well, as always, Google is still playing catch-up.\u201cWith the emergence of generative AI and Large Language Models, [creating the Star Trek Computer] now seems like a very tractable problem,\u201d he told me.RelatedAll the news from Amazon\u2019s September 2023 product launch event\n\nTo keep up with every big tech and entertainment event going on this fall, complete with any updates and last-minute additions, open up Google Calendar in a desktop browser window and add our fall event calendar using this link or individual links for the events included below \u2014 they may not work if you\u2019re on a mobile device in the Calendar app, but it will on the website.Amazon\u2019s smart home ambitions hinge on generative AI and a new hardware focus\n\nIf Amazon is to fulfill its ambitions to create a \u201cdramatically different experience\u201d in its ambient smart home with generative AI, it will still need hardware to power that experience.Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nThe smart home has stagnated because it\u2019s too complicated \u2014 yes, even in the (not so) golden age of Matter.If you\u2019re on a mobile device or another calendar platform, you can also try subscribing via this iCal link.For the vast majority of American consumers, the TV is that trusted device that could provide a soft landing for the leap to the smart home.The Fire TV Cube is the high end, but imagine a Fire TV Stick or the inexpensive Fire TV Omnis with Thread and Zigbee smart home hardware built in.\u201cIt now feels like we have the tools to get there.\u201d While Limp is out, his rumored replacement, Microsoft\u2019s Panay, is similarly AI-savvy and unlikely to move away from this vision, which has been at the core of Alexa since day one.Context is king in the smart home \u2014 a home that turns on your lights at 3AM because it\u2019s dark outside isn\u2019t smart.Apple\u2019s new tvOS update makes the Apple TV interface more useful for smart home control \u2014 giving you quick access to scenes and cameras on the big screen.Now, it needs to focus on the software.Roku has seen this potential with its smart home hardware play \u2014 repackaging Wyze cameras and gadgets but integrating them neatly into its TV OS.Smart displays simply aren\u2019t compelling enough.Amazon has the hardware it needs (more than it needs!).This is what Samsung is doing with its TVs, packing Thread and Zigbee radios and Matter controller capabilities into its fanciest 2023 models, with this likely to permeate through the rest of its lines in 2024.This week's event at its shiny new headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, is a prime opportunity for Amazon to show it truly understands its smart home mission.And here is where the TV makes sense.The obvious place to do this is by bringing its Alexa and Fire TV division and its devices and services division into closer alignment.In my decade-plus of covering the smart home, it\u2019s baffled me that no company has really embraced the TV as a central hub for the smart home.But the current hardware play needs to shift away from the \u201cthrow everything at the wall and see what sticks\u201d approach to find a tighter focus.Amazon\u2019s Fire Cube TV could be so much more.\u201cOur North Star is the Star Trek Computer,\u201d Limp told me earlier this year, before the news of his departure.No one has successfully turned the biggest smart display in our homes into a usable smart home controller, and really, they should.It\u2019s a natural step for Amazon to turn the TV into the hub of its smart home ecosystem, and maybe even package some smart home services into your Prime subscription.We all signed up for free delivery, but now we\u2019re hooked on an all-you-can-eat buffet of Good Omens and Tom Clancy\u2019s Jack Ryan; who\u2019s to say there aren\u2019t some compelling smart home services we\u2019d be happy to bundle, too?Of course, all of this could be largely moot if Amazon is ever able to achieve its much-touted goal of the \u201cambient home\u201d \u2014 one that responds intuitively and proactively to the needs and wants of its occupants with little to no input or direction from us humans.",

a lesser manufacturer might've opted for a cheaper 720p camera here instead, considering the overall price.Around the edges of the Helios Neo 16, we've got a veritable smorgasbord of physical ports - something I love to see in this era of MacBook-inspired port minimalism.Read the full Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 reviewHow I tested the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16Replaced my everyday system for one weekUsed for general gaming for around two weeksI played a wide variety of games on the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16, not just our regular suite of test titles.Although the more affordable versions pack an FHD display, my review unit is a slightly pricier model packing a QHD+ screen that looks fantastic.This one's best left on your desk at home.You want top-notch performance\nWhile the RTX 4060 does give strong gaming performance, there's no denying that there are more powerful gaming laptops out there right now, even considering the 4070 configurations available in some regions.Let's take a deeper look.Acer Predator Helios Neo 16: Price & availabilityHow much does it cost?How does it stack up against rival laptops in the same price range?Configurable all the way up to an RTX 4090 and Core i9 CPU, this laptop is a beast - just bear in mind that it's a fair lick more expensive than the Neo 16.(Image credit: Future)Now, I'm not saying that the Helios Neo 16 is worthy of our best budget laptops list - it's still a gaming laptop and therefore not exactly cheap, as you'll see below.With this redesign of Acer's existing Helios laptop line, we've still got a high-quality machine with the latest internal components, but now at a new (and more accessible) price point.The 1600p resolution on my review unit is excellent, with strong color density and deep blacks.Considering that this isn't an OLED screen, it's one of the best IPS displays I've seen on a laptop.While the pad itself felt suitably responsive and offered a decent amount of tactile feedback when clicked, the positioning seems a little... off.(Image credit: Future)The overall casing is plastic, not the machined aluminum you'll find on more expensive gaming laptops, but it doesn't feel flimsy.I've long been a fan of the 16:10 aspect ratio now becoming more common in laptops since it gives you that extra little bit of vertical screen real estate that makes scrolling through web pages or documents a little easier.Acer Predator Helios Neo 16: Two-minute reviewAcer's Predator line of laptops is well-known at this point, offering everything from desktops like the Acer Orion 7000 to high-end laptops such as the Acer Helios 300.My understanding is that not every Neo model has this design, but it certainly adds to the aesthetic of the laptop and makes it a bit more eye-catching than the average gaming system.Opening the Neo up, I'm immediately treated to an excellent display.Please don't starve me of my ports; I still use physical flash drives!Design score: 4\u00a0/ 5Acer Predator Helios Neo 16: PerformanceDecent gaming performance4060 can run anything at 1080p, most games at QHD+Fans are loud but the system runs coolAcer Predator Helios Neo 16: BenchmarksHere's how the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 performed in our suite of benchmark tests:3DMark Night Raid: 65,825; Fire Strike: 24,487; Time Spy: 11,146 \nGeekBench 6: 2,490 (single-core); 14,658 (multi-core)\nTotal War: Warhammer III: 1080p Ultra: 83.6 1080p Low: 223.8\nDirt 5: 1080p Ultra: 97.2 1080p Low: 164.6\nCyberpunk: 1080p Ultra RT: 61.1 1080p Low: 152.0\nPCMark 10 Battery Life: 1hr 41m\nTechRadar Movie Battery Life: 2hr 55m\u00a0Considering the price tag, my RTX 4060-equipped review model of the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 performed admirably.(Image credit: Future)Dial things up to native resolution, and you might find yourself having to drop your graphical settings a tad to maintain a high framerate, though this won't be the case for every game.The fans are custom-engineered all-metal 'AeroBlades' connected to five heat pipes and liquid metal thermal grease, which evidently works as advertised - props to Acer's laptop cooling team.Performance score: 4\u00a0/ 5Acer Predator Helios Neo 16: Battery lifeUnimpressive battery lifeLarge, heavy AC adapterSure, gaming laptops are hardly known for their all-day battery longevity, but it's always nice to find one that outlasts the competition.The Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 is sadly not that laptop, clocking in at less than two hours in the PCMark 10 mixed-use battery life test and only faring a bit better in our looped video playback test.What's new?3 / 5 Average ratingA solid effort from Acer to reimagine its Helios line into something a bit more accessible - but not lacking in performance or aesthetics.4 / 5Buy it if...You want good value for money\nThe Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 is competitively priced with a sensible starting price, meaning you get plenty of bang for your buck here - the higher-spec configurations aren't ridiculously expensive, either.You want a multipurpose machine\nThe comfortable keyboard and 16:10 display make the Helios Neo 16 a perfectly good choice if you want a desktop-replacement laptop that will serve you for work just as well as play.Don't buy it if...You crave portability\nThe Neo isn't just a big laptop, it's also on the heavy side - and with its poor battery life, you'll also have to lug around the chunky AC adapter.The palm rejection worked fine for the most part, although there were one or two occasions when my left thumb would catch the touchpad and register unwanted input while I was gaming.The latest gaming machine to grace my test bench is the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 - a more budget-conscious entry into the Predator line.That's a welcome sight since many of the best gaming laptops are fearsomely expensive; sure, I love the new Razer Blade 14, but it starts above two thousand bucks, and the average person just can't afford to casually drop that amount of money on a gaming machine.I've done my best to include the base, review, and high-end configurations here, but bear in mind that the top-spec model listed below isn't actually available in the US (not yet, anyway).Swipe to scroll horizontallyThese are the specs for the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 ComponentBase modelReview unitTop configurationPrice$1,199.99 / \u00a31,399 / AU$1,998$1,549.99 / \u00a31,399 / around AU$2,400\u00a31,799 / AU$3,999 (about $2,230)CPUIntel Core i5-13500HXIntel Core i7-13700HXIntel Core i5-13500HXGPUNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070RAM16GB DDR516GB DDR532GB DDR5Storage512GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD1 TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD1 TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSDScreen16-inch FHD+ (1920 x 1200), 16:10, 165 Hz16-inch QHD+ (2560 x 1600), 16:10, 165 Hz16-inch QHD+ (2560 x 16000), 16:10, 165 HzPorts3x USB-A, 2x USB-C Thunderbolt 4, 1x HDMI, 1x RJ-45 Ethernet, 1x microSD, 1x 3.5mm combi audio jack3x USB-A, 2x USB-C Thunderbolt 4, 1x HDMI, 1x RJ-45 Ethernet, 1x microSD, 1x 3.5mm combi audio jack3x USB-A, 2x USB-C Thunderbolt 4, 1x HDMI, 1x RJ-45 Ethernet, 1x microSD, 1x 3.5mm combi audio jackWirelessWi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.1Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.1Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.1Camera1080p webcam1080p webcam1080p webcamWeight2.80 kg (6.17 lb)2.80 kg (6.17 lb)2.80 kg (6.17 lb)Dimensions36.1 x 27.9 x 2.8 cm36.1 x 27.9 x 2.8 cm36.1 x 27.9 x 2.8 cm(Image credit: Future)Acer Predator Helios Neo 16: DesignStylish designBeautiful displayPlenty of physical portsThe first thing I noticed upon unboxing the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 was the printed design on the exterior of the lid.Boy, those suckers are LOUD, even when using the balanced power preset.I ended up disabling the pad since I was using a mouse anyway.I've seen slightly better figures from other 4060-wielding laptops, but the difference is pretty marginal.If you drop the resolution to 1080p (the standard we use for benchmarking games), there's basically nothing you can't play with a clean framerate.(Image credit: Future)Moving down to the laptop's bottom half, we've got a relatively normal membrane keyboard that is mostly comfortable to use.I spent a decent amount of time in the evenings replaying Deathloop and also dipped my toe back into Apex Legends and Valorant (the latter of which I still suck at).To test the brightness and glare resistance of the display, I used it during the daytime and at night, even sitting out in my backyard in the middle of the day.Available nowWhere can you get it?Trust me, you don't want to try using a 16-inch gaming laptop on British public transport.Middle-of-the-road is perfectly fine at this sort of price point though, so I can't complain.I will complain about the touchpad, however!Ultimately though, most buyers will (and should) primarily use this as a desktop-replacement system, so it's not a huge issue - or at least, it's an issue shared by 95% of gaming laptops, so I can't knock the Neo too much for it.Battery score: 3\u00a0/ 5Should you buy the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16?Swipe to scroll horizontallyAcer Predator Helios Neo 16AttributesNotesRatingPriceIn a world of $2,000+ gaming laptops, the low starting price of the Helios Neo 16 is a welcome sight.4.5 / 5DesignA straightforward design that won't set the world on fire but offers everything you realistically need - including loads of ports.4/ 5PerformanceThe RTX 4060 carries the Neo well, putting it head and shoulders above many previous-generation gaming laptops.4 / 5BatteryDeeply average battery life, but hey, it's a gaming laptop.The large size of the touchpad - otherwise a good feature - made this an issue, though I imagine many users wouldn't have the same problem.While the Neo comes with a perfectly acceptable 16GB of RAM in most configurations, it can be upgraded to 32GB if you're planning to run any memory-intensive software.I used it in place of my desktop PC to write most of this review as well as some of my regular everyday work, including video calls to test the webcam.I also took the Neo with me to my friend's house, playing the rather excellent Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun for a brief period on the train.It's set to the left-hand side (already a risky move since the standard gamer hand position sees your fingers sitting atop the WASD keys), but it's also not properly aligned with the spacebar.I actually struggled to put my finger on what exactly was putting me off, but it just feels slightly wrong.The 165Hz refresh rate (also found in the cheaper 1200p version of this display) is a great inclusion for anyone who plays fast-paced competitive games.In practical gaming tests I got similar results, with just over 90 minutes of playing Deathloop using the balanced power preset before the laptop gave up the ghost.Starting at $1,199.99 / \u00a31,399 / AU$1,998\u00a0When is it available?(Image credit: Future)The Neo does at least charge pretty quickly, but the included AC adapter is huge and heavy, which severely impacts the laptop's portability.The anti-glare coating works well in all but the most brightly lit environments, and the maximum brightness of 500 nits is excellent.We've got 3 USB-As, 2 USB-C with Thunderbolt 4, HDMI for video output, RJ-45 for wired internet, a headphone jack, and even a microSD port.This level of port support should be considered aspirational among gaming laptop makers.With this goalpost-moving in mind, I feel pretty comfortable saying that the Helios Neo 16 is actually a great-value product, despite costing more than a budget gaming laptop did five or ten years ago.Interestingly, the aforementioned entry-level RTX 4050 model is already on sale at Best Buy at the time of writing, going for just $999.99 - a pretty stellar deal in today's gaming laptop market, so consider snapping that one up!Price score: 4.5\u00a0/ 5Acer Predator Helios Neo 16: SpecsAs I noted above, configurations of the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 vary wildly between regions.Available in the US, the UK and AustraliaThe Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 starts at $1,199.99 / \u00a31,399 / AU$1,998, although I noted while verifying prices for different models that the base US configuration (which features an RTX 4050 GPU) actually isn't available in the UK and Australia; those starting prices are for RTX 4060 models.The highest-end model, which uses an RTX 4070 and i7-13700HX, will run you \u00a31,799 / AU$3,999 (about $2,230), though I couldn't find that configuration anywhere in the States.The highest-spec model there appears to be my review unit, which features an RTX 4060 and costs $1,549.99 / \u00a31,399 (around AU$2,400).While these prices aren't exactly budget, the definition of an 'affordable gaming laptop' has shifted somewhat over the last few years.Knock things up to Turbo mode and it sounds like a jet engine firing in your living room.That being said, the Neo did run pretty darn cool throughout my whole testing process, so those fans are clearly doing the job.If you want the best of the best, you'll need to stump up more cash.Acer Predator Helios Neo 16: Also considerSwipe to scroll horizontally Acer Predator Helios Neo 16Lenovo Legion Pro 5iAsus ROG Zephyrus M16 (2023)Price:$1,549.99 / \u00a31,399 / around AU$2,400$1,449.99 / \u00a31,840 / AU$3,599$3,499.99 / \u00a33,299.99 / around AU$5,218CPUIntel Core i7-13700HXIntel Core i7-13700HXIntel Core i9-13900HGPUNvidia GeForce RTX 4060 8GB GDDR6Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 8GB GDDR6Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090RAM16GB DDR516GB DDR532GB DDR5Display16-inch QHD+ (2560 x 1600), 16:10, 165 Hz16-inch WQXGA (2560 x 1600), IPS, Anti-Glare, Non-Touch, 100% sRGB, 300 nits, 165Hz, LED Backlight16-inch QHD+ 16:10 (2560 x 1600, WQXGA) Mini-LED, 1,100 nits brightness, HDR, DCI-P3: 100%, Refresh Rate 240HzStorage1 TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD512GB SSD2TB SSDPorts3x USB-A, 2x USB-C Thunderbolt 4, 1x HDMI, 1x RJ-45 Ethernet, 1x microSD, 1x 3.5mm combi audio jack3x USB 3.2 Gen 1, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1, 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (DisplayPort 1.4), 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (DisplayPort 1.4), 1x HDMI, 1x Ethernet, 1x Headphone / microphone combo jack, 1x Power connector1x 3.5mm combo audio jack, 1x HDMI 2.1 FRL, 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, 1x Thunderbolt 4, microSD reader, Kensington LockWirelessWi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.1Wi-Fi 6E 2x2 AX, Bluetooth 5.1 or aboveWi-Fi 6E(802.11ax) (Triple band) 2 x 2 + Bluetooth 5.2Camera1080p webcam1080p webcam with E-shutter1080p IR webcamWeight2.80 kg2.5 kg2.30kgDimensions36.1 x 27.9 x 2.8 cm36.3 x 26.0 x 2.23 cm35.5 x 24.6 x 2.11 ~ 2.29 cmIf the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 has you considering other options, here are two more laptops to consider...Lenovo Legion Pro 5i\nProbably one of the closest laptops to the Helios Neo 16 in terms of pure internal specs, the Legion Pro 5i is a great choice that can also pull double duty as a work machine and a gaming rig.Read the full Lenovo Legion Pro 5i reviewAsus ROG Zephyrus M16\nIf you want something with a bit more power under the hood, the Zephyrus M16 is an excellent choice.In today's fraught economic landscape, good-value hardware is king - and I reckon the Predator Helios Neo 16 checks that box.Even Cyberpunk 2077's Ultra preset with ray-tracing turned on just about managed to clear the 60fps barrier, and performance in synthetic tests was also strong.I was able to play Dirt 5 at 1600p Ultra without my fps dropping below 60, and plenty of games can now take advantage of Nvidia's DLSS upscaling tech to boost framerates when you're playing above 1080p.CPU performance was also pretty strong - again, not the very best I've seen, but great when factoring in the price point here.(Image credit: Future)My only real gripe with the Helios Neo 16 during my testing process was the fan noise.",

CPU product families that would replace its Meteor Lake CPUs that launch in December.Intel 20A will be the first process node to include PowerVia, backside power delivery technology, and the new gate-all-around transistor design called RibbonFET.You can expect all the latest and greatest innovations from Intel such as Foveros packaging (25um pitch).Panther Lake CPUs are expected to feature Cougar Cove P-Cores and deploy the next-gen Xe3 GPU architecture, codenamed Celestial.What the blue team showcased today is a great roadmap with several products laid out for client PCs in the coming years.The CPU will utilize a sub-20A node as its process technology alongside an external foundry node for various other IPs since this will be a multi-tiled chip design.The Lunar Lake CPUs are positioned against Apple's M-class chips for its own Macbook and Mac systems while also tackling AMD APU architectures with a chiplet-esque design.18A, which also leverages PowerVia and RibbonFET, remains on track to be manufacturing-ready in the second half of 2024.\nvia\nI know mobility is fun stuff but most of our readers are interested in what the next-gen desktop CPU family is going to look like and Arrow Lake will indeed be heading to the next-gen LGA 1851 socket featured on 800-series motherboards with the following features:\n\nLGA 1851 Socket Longevity Planned Uptill 2026\nDDR5 Only Compatibility, No DDR4 Support\nKicks off With 800-Series Motherboards\nSupport For Up To DDR5-6400 Memory (Native JEDEC)\nIncreased PCIe Gen 5.0 Lanes Through CPU & PCH\nArrow Lake-S First Desktop Family Supported\nArrow Lake-S CPUs feature 3 MB L2 Cache Per P-Core\nArrow Lake-S CPUs feature refreshed Alchemist iGPUs\nArrow Lake-S CPUs feature integrated LLC \"Adamantine\" for GPU Tile\nArrow Lake-S CPUs feature 8+16, 8+0, 6+8 CPU SKUs\nLaunching In 2H 2024\n\nIn addition to that, Intel also showcased a demo unit featuring the next-gen Lunar Lake CPUs which are not only powering on but also booting into the operating system which is a key development.Each CPU will offer a generational improvement over the last one, in terms of core, graphics, and efficiency capabilities.First up, we have Arrow Lake which according to CEO, Pat Gelsinger, is hot out of fab and utilizes the 20A process node with production commencing next year and arrival expected in the second half of 2024.The Panther Lake CPUs are said to be a follow-on to Lunar Lake and are likely to be headed to both laptops and desktops too.Lunar Lake CPUs are specifically going to target the mobile platform only, featuring a brand-new CPU architecture built from the ground up which will mark a major improvement over Arrow Lake.Lastly, we have Panther Lake which is confirmed to be a 2025 product.Now we only have to see if these products will meet schedule which has been the biggest concern for Chipzilla but considering that they are getting their grips back, we're likely to see a

            "content": "Its been a rocky and chaotic decade and now digital media is on the brink of yet another existential crisis thanks to generative AI.\r\nByNilay Patel, editor-in-chief of the Verge, host of the Decoder \u2026 [+46973 chars]",
            "paraphrased_content": "You know, the stage went from like, \u201cHey, Mike does the bulk of the interviews and a couple of other people guest star here and there\u201d to \u201cYou saw all my people onstage.\u201d Or the most we could muster or the most that were willing.I tried to keep that.And that valuable audience is the thing that draws people to us, but it is also the danger.The idea that you would be able to suss out nascent trends or new bits of technology that were being productized out of the ether, out of academic programs, or out of new technological discoveries, or remixes, as we all know, of traditional businesses that were enabled by\u2026 you strap a database to a laundromat and you\u2019ve got a business, right?It\u2019s pretty crazy.That some of this stuff is going to be really cool and clever and world-changing in a positive way.We have a lot of access, but I think \u2014 this is just two editors-in-chief doing their own sayings all the time \u2014 my saying to my staff is the less you need it, the more you get.It\u2019s just I think it behooves ourselves to value, as you said, the human quotient.Okay, Matthew Panzarino, former editor-in-chief of TechCrunch.Because, in the beginning, the only outlet that was covering any of these companies was TechCrunch, right?Or do you think it ebbs and flows, and you have to correct it?And we\u2019d be like, \u201cOh yeah, so-and-so\u2019s talking to me about it.Our internal policy, which I think we published externally at some point, but I can\u2019t remember, but our policy is like, \u201cHey, you know, mess with these tools as much as possible.That\u2019s what drives media.Let me make sure this lands correctly, all of that.\u201d And then I finally got to the point where I was like, \u201cOkay, you know, this is the moment.That is a distribution channel that feels like it\u2019s going to change.There were just a lot of people who had an idea, and they could glue it to our thing without any understanding of our thing.Is this why you\u2019re stepping away?We do have some reporters writing about venture-specific stuff there as well because TechCrunch is sort of like the ultimate navel-gazing publication.That is the important bit that I think a lot of these places miss.And Matt has somehow led TechCrunch with a steady hand through all of it.That\u2019s the way we viewed ourselves.Because you are just a person embodying a role.It becomes a good portion of the job.We don\u2019t need your participation, we\u2019re going to go and just do a bunch of reporting.I don\u2019t care.They\u2019ll eat it because they believe us.\u201d\n\nBut I think that\u2019s why \u2014 and we mentioned earlier, ebbs and flows \u2014 there were definitely periods of time where people were like, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to TechCrunch; don\u2019t talk to any media,\u201d and stories got a little bit thinner and harder to tease out because there were a lot of mandates about talking to media.Like, why else are we here?So we\u2019re seeing publications like Punchbowl, they\u2019re doing really well.Do you think that that\u2019s been in balance?Being sharks, hunting your own food versus being fed in your inbox.\u201d There are a thousand things in my inbox I could write.Do you think that you see it differently over time?So you just tell me what to do.You took over in sort of the aftermath of all of this, right?There\u2019s nothing deeper really behind it.So why go out and find the thing that\u2019s hard to find to write about?I\u2019m definitely commenting on previous... First of all, they haven\u2019t really been around long enough to screw anything up, but I don\u2019t think they are.You have to be really sure of that.We were fighting against the titans of the industry.And so, that\u2019s her job going forward: to figure out ways to twiddle those dials to make sure that the traffic keeps growing.The whole original conversation was, \u201cThere are a ton of startups and a ton of founders that are outside of the normal Stanford to Sand Hill Road ecosystem.Alexia Tsotsis [now Bonatsos] and I ran TechCrunch together for about 18 months, and then she went off to get her MBA and be a world-famous VC, and I stayed on as editor-in-chief.They don\u2019t get us, and they don\u2019t get our world.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has always dodged that a little bit because we do put in the effort to get to the white paper and we write a lot about APIs and understanding that stuff.It\u2019s now rebranded as TechCrunch Plus.And the resulting explosion is going to wipe out an entire generation of media companies, I think.Decoder with Nilay Patel  / A podcast about big ideas and other problems.SUBSCRIBE NOW!You\u2019ve got some ownership that is stable that you seem to like.Code returns with new hosts at The Ritz-Carlton, Laguna Niguel September 26th\u201327th.I don\u2019t know how the churn is on that, but at the very least, you\u2019ve got action in your network and your building and all of that.Why not lean into the expertise of these people who are strapping on their galoshes and wading out into the swamp of crazy new ideas and companies and technology?I think most media companies are existentially dependent on Google in a way that they\u2019re only just realizing now because of generative AI.And I had good partners over the years, thankfully, in our business side, that we were able to fend off a lot of that with a lot of very long memos, maybe some threats, maybe some, you know, very polite, very straightforward threats.I think all of us always struggle with this idea that if you want to generate traffic, a large portion of that traffic is going to come from stories that have already broken.All of them want it.But what about all the people outside of those networks?Y Combinator\u2019s companies, their first 1,000 customers usually are other YC companies.You\u2019ve really grown the place.Here we go!Now, obviously, that does torpedo all of the businesses that were in the business of re-reporting and repackaging and taking that fresh information and redistributing it through larger channels.If you\u2019re a Decoder listener, I probably don\u2019t have to tell you that TechCrunch is a big deal \u2014 it is one of the most important trade publications in the world of tech and startups, and its annual Disrupt conference is where dozens of major companies have launched\u2026 and some have failed.I would go bonkers if people were more outraged about it.The CEO, Jim Lanzone, not only has led a couple of really big media turnarounds but also launched his company at Disrupt.We\u2019re gonna get to the AI conversation very soon.A lot of the other ones are just really entertainment-based.Over the past decade, you and I have both seen tech go from a marginal thing that geeks cared about to everyone being forced to be geeks.So inherently, at least now, it sidesteps the whole gen AI model scraping thing because all of those models are two years old right now.We either interview and do our taste thing or bring in experts to write about operational stuff because \u2014 if you want to drill back to the earliest days of us discussing this from the editorial side, the business side, of course, very straightforward \u2014 we need recurring revenue.All of that is a lot!And if you\u2019re of the mind that you want to do it right and you want to make sure that they\u2019re on good footing, there always seems to be a thing coming that the hubris of the position tells you that only you can handle \u2014 only you can guide them through this next era.Like you start covering them pretty early.That is a balance she\u2019ll have to strike.And that will actually, over time, dilute the brand and remove the audience\u201d \u2014 which I feel very comfortable making fun of AOL because I haven\u2019t worked there in a long time.You cannot write a handbook to make that culture stick.Every now and again, The Verge is pretentious enough to say we can do that, and that\u2019s often when we do our best work.And so there was the temptation to be the person who did the big thing with TechCrunch.I have to say this, it was never any weird cackling villain above us in the corporate architecture of AOL or Oath or Verizon or whatever that was like, \u201cFinally, we get to mess with TechCrunch.\u201d It never felt like that.They\u2019re subscribing, that is the recurring revenue that drives this product.I would have loved to have done a lot more, launched a lot more.I fundamentally think access is poison, and I think a lot of our editorial ethos stems from that.When you\u2019re reading the story, you\u2019re like, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen next?Where has Extra Crunch landed now?You\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s ready, and you\u2019re exhausted by the fights?Technology has invaded every aspect of our lives, and unless you\u2019re a Luddite or a homesteader \u2014 and even then all homesteaders are solar-powered now \u2014 technology is everywhere.My job was how do we do that but actually make a good product for our readers \u2014 not just sell them on something that\u2019s worthless?That\u2019s the thing, right?We can talk to you now, we can talk to you later, we can write about you without your participation, which is fine.I don\u2019t know.I believe it, you know?\u2019\u201d Like what truth did you draw out of them?And there were a bunch of those, so it took me a while, for sure.Just tell me about that moment when you started moving it away from being about a person and more into a brand.We were writing about those a decade ago for sure.Apply to attend\u00a0here or grab a virtual ticket.It was kind of wild.They\u2019re going to get you probably your first customers.And it\u2019s not about a \u201cgotcha\u201d; it\u2019s about having a honing edge to pull out the truth.And that honing bit is what\u2019s exciting.Although, our policy is slightly different, which is: just be honest.Some people just don\u2019t like the stage work, which is fine.It was very simple, very straightforward.TechCrunch has a really unique role in this ecosystem.No.Doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s your grandma or whether it\u2019s your brother or cousin or nephew or parents.We had long conversations about it, and you were like \u201cehh,\u201d and then we discovered that it was because you were going to go to TechCrunch.A lot of people had been there eight years, 10 years, 12 years, which is crazy in media, completely unheard of.When I worked at AOL, the phrase that we always used was a Steve Jobs quote.You don\u2019t need the media.But in fact, editing is all about taste and curating\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s weird how much they don\u2019t realize that the excitement and energy that comes from reading an article on a place like TechCrunch or The Verge or any place like that is the friction.They viewed the media as the easy part and the money as the hard part, when, in fact, many times it\u2019s the other way around.Matt has been the editor-in-chief of TechCrunch for essentially a decade now, and he and I have been both friends and competitors the entire time.It\u2019s all tied up in there.Who cares?People like to hear that stuff.There are so many things I wanted to launch and do and create and help this team do.There was definitely a lot of trepidation on my part because I\u2019m not a drama-driven person.I mean, obviously, we\u2019ll reach out and we\u2019ll talk to you.And then, if there comes a time to utilize it to amplify things or to use it in a fun or clever or interesting way, cool.If I don\u2019t do it now\u2026\u201d And I used the 10-year anniversary of my joining as a sort of excuse to throw myself out of the nest.I do not know.You and I have lived through maybe too much, maybe too many changes.\u201cOh yeah, narrative is super important.Or is that more of the same with more attitude?So it was the default.A lot of coverage in TechCrunch is very trade publication-y; here\u2019s some news that is happening in our industry.\u201cIf you want to emphasize original reporting, you have to by nature understand that original means new, and new generally means you have to convince people to be interested\u201d\n\nSo I don\u2019t know, Instagram launches a thing or acquires a thing or whatever.But the content that does the best on TechCrunch Plus is still operational advice stuff.Is that a new emphasis?We pick these companies and then throw them to the wolves, and we tell the investors, \u201cYou can ask anything you want.\u201d There\u2019s no glad-handing.That part where AOL bought TechCrunch led somewhat directly to the founding of The Verge.I don\u2019t know anything about their revenue, but I think that they\u2019re doing well.Simple philosophy.\u201d\n\nSo I was a little bit leery of that coming from a place where, while we were very scrappy at The Next Web, there was a team ethos that played out really well.And definitely LLMs.I tried to keep a lot of the kind of anarchistic ethos around editorial choice and story selection.Thank you, I appreciate you having me and letting me bloviate a bit.They wanted to invest in it in weird, trendy ways, which you and I both have seen all of those trends come and go.Some of the bigger names that come to the stage, it\u2019s going to be reflective in nature.To counter that, I say, the VC apparatus and the whole universe there that has its own momentum and so much money and so much power, they tried to spin up media, right?It\u2019s thick and sticky with all of the stuff that these folks want.The idea that you are able to set an editorial policy around the mixture of access-driven stories versus non or funding-driven stories versus broader text stories or whatever \u2014 that you can set some sort of policy and let it ride for any amount of time \u2014 is hubris.We\u2019re all geeks now because we all have to be.\u201d\n\nWhat are the things we can talk about that are too soon so that, over the next year, people have this reference point looking back and going, \u201cOh yeah, they were onstage at Disrupt.\u201d Or we can at least remind them, you know, through marketing \u2014 \u201cOh yeah, we talked about these folks at Disrupt.I need a break from media, and media probably needs a break from me.Recruiting, additional funding, and early adopters \u2014 all of those things.Okay, covid, oh, crud, you know, we have to do virtual events all of a sudden.Fundamentally, the less you need the access, the more it will be bestowed upon you.This is the stuff that keeps me up at night.Very specific, right?It\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do more original reporting.\u201d Do you think that\u2019s going to be a change?We\u2019re all geeks now because we all have to be.It\u2019s like a godly fear.The idea there was that there was a need in the market for information for people building startups.Advertising, yes, makes money for sure.TechCrunch plays a really interesting role in the tech business ecosystem, particularly the startup ecosystem.Right, exactly.Most of us never really talk about it that much because we\u2019re like, \u201cWhatever, we have other things to do than to crow about this.\u201d But that is the fact that the people that are the most ardent about people not needing the media are the people who are in our inbox the most and texting and being like, \u201cOh, I got this company, you gotta look at these people, you gotta look at this; it\u2019s so good, it stands out.\u201d\n\nBut the fact is who tells your story is a choice.And then, of course, the big thinkers in the tech industry are like, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t need coms, go direct\u201d or \u201cYou don\u2019t need publications, go direct.\u201d It can go in waves, for sure.They wanted to talk direct.It\u2019s like, \u201cHey, you\u2019re not going to stop us from writing about you.\u201d So the participation part of it is 100 percent your choice.Taking that through, pulling that throughline all the way through the years, the eight to 10 years of service.I want to work on something.But that\u2019s what happened.\u201cThey viewed editing as a job as putting things in the right package.But I will say, it goes in waves.What did they tease out of them that they didn\u2019t want to say or weren\u2019t ready to say, but they\u2019re like, \u2018Fuck it, I\u2019m going to say it.There is an ebb and flow to it that can ride on public sentiment.These deep ethos stuff like: why hire smart people and not let them do their thing?It is, in many ways, the publication of record for startups.They\u2019re going to find it because you\u2019re going to deliver some more value.So the job of TechCrunch has always been to find those nascent things, pull them out, tease them out, and talk about them earlier than everyone else.What are your big learnings from XYZ?It\u2019s a lot of tenure there, and I think that\u2019s what maintains the culture.And then you became the editor of TechCrunch in a tumultuous time in the post-Michael Arrington era.And then there\u2019s the looming sort of AI.You can go pay someone to pay Forbes to do it.These days, it is a little bit different, and the new editor-in-chief of TechCrunch and whoever takes it on from here will have their own job because I think, like you, that we are at a watershed moment not only for media but also for tech.This is, you and I both know, editing.We would want to add reporting and kind of write.Yeah, I think that\u2019s it.It\u2019s a funny thing because when you have a bit of leverage and a bit of clout and are able to exercise your leverage to fight off bad ideas and all of that stuff, it\u2019s gratifying, but it\u2019s also exhausting.But the access thing is weird because everybody does want attention from TechCrunch.That was the thing, it\u2019s like Extra Crunch.I hear this from founders all the time.So I\u2019ll be doing that.Just putting the logo of a big publication on your website, it means something to a lot of people \u2014 this other person wrote about us.She left to start her own newsletter.I get it.And so you have this shift where the spelunking is getting harder and weirder.I mean, as much attention as was given TechCrunch in the early days, now that there are thousands of companies being founded every quarter, all of those want coverage in TechCrunch.Google Search is changing.I think that kind of thing is the thing we\u2019re going to be seeing more of.Our ambitions for that product and for other things that we launched over the years were \u2014 just to be frank \u2014 severely curtailed by the fact that the various owners of TechCrunch over the years didn\u2019t really want to invest in it in the ways that we wanted to.We also take time to discuss the future.TechCrunch Plus, these days, is a mixture of analysis of industries that we view as important and compelling and pivotal at the moment.I think that\u2019s for her to decide and define, and I wouldn\u2019t want to walk over her on any of that stuff.That\u2019s a great benefit for being a YC company.Any media company can succeed if you apply money in the appropriate way.He led it to what it was at that point.If you\u2019re going to do that kind of work, you\u2019re going to generate traffic because people already know what that thing is.\u201cWhy not have these great people and use them to their fullest?That was the genesis.The newsletter has been reacquired.Definitely.You have a successor, Connie Loizos.No, no, it\u2019s totally fine.You took over when?I liked a lot of the people.Because they want their side of the story told, basically.What\u2019s next for you, Matt?I think we are at a generational reset in media on the internet.The difference between TechCrunch and a broader publication or a very good, very well-staffed, very astute bureau at a larger paper of record like The New York Times or the Journal or whatever \u2014 I\u2019m not singling anybody out, but like, any one of those great chunks of tech writers that exist within a larger organization \u2014 the differential between us and them is that we very, very, very specifically wanted to be as fast and close to this stuff as possible without, of course, abandoning all reason.Then generative AI itself, media companies that care less about anything but traffic are already deploying it basically to arbitrage search results and get traffic for their crappy ads.We should give that to the customer.And we didn\u2019t break that story, but we bring, say, original analysis to the story.So when Matt announced last month that he\u2019s stepping down from his role at TechCrunch and handing the reins to StrictlyVC founder Connie Loizos, it felt important to have him come on Decoder for what you might call an exit interview \u2014 a look back at the past decade running a media outlet at the center of the tech ecosystem, with all of the chaos that\u2019s entailed.And then it was one every couple of weeks because we have a lot of people who have been with TechCrunch a long time, and they don\u2019t need to hear from me that much.So it could be that the media industry overall stays roughly the same size but every organization within media is much smaller and much leaner.It\u2019s driving me crazy.It was 100 percent the malaise of big corp stuff.If you\u2019re generating original thought endlessly and fresh information, then the remixing of it is a sort of nonentity to you.Could Google\u2019s push to blend language models with its search engine turn off the business model of digital media?Probably not.But it is honestly a miracle that it exists the way it does now.And so, you can choose to say, at the earliest stages, \u201cWe\u2019re going to write our own narrative and control our own narrative.\u201d But the conundrum is, if you\u2019re successful, your company is going to be scalar, and that narrative is going to be the property of hundreds, thousands, or millions of people, especially if it\u2019s a consumer-facing company.Although that\u2019s a story for another time.It is of the moment.The sparks that are flying between a person whose job it is to be healthily oppositional to a person that is trying to tell their narrative.Obviously, we would never just parrot somebody else\u2019s reporting.As of currently, the public stance is that I\u2019m doing some consulting for Yahoo, which obviously includes landing some Disrupt for them next week.There\u2019s already interest in this thing.You launched a paid tier with Extra Crunch.And I\u2019m sure you folks were, too.I\u2019m not going to couch this in terms of what I would do if I ran TechCrunch; totally unfair to Connie and not my job.Specific audiences, with specific needs, being addressed by people that know all of the memes that they know, that are up to the moment with the thing that is happening with that particular area of obsession and that are willing to take the conversation further from there, tell them something they don\u2019t know about that thing.The taste you are describing requires you to have a point of view and stay focused on it instead of doing what people want to hear.So let\u2019s end with some big thinks about the future of media.And that\u2019s the balance she\u2019ll have to strike.I understood that my role, if I didn\u2019t do it, nobody was going to do it.There\u2019s one line in there that really stuck with me.We don\u2019t have the largest audience in the world, but our audience is extremely high honey.It goes from zero to 100 so, so, so quick now.Simple philosophy.And now, it is not that thing.The external example would be definitely a big trend toward, \u201cHey, we need to own the narrative because the mainstream media is just not getting how transformative tech is, and they just don\u2019t get it.You\u2019re looking at the mix of stories hitting the site, you\u2019re looking at the editorial calendar, and you\u2019re balancing that out and saying, \u201cOkay, look, we need to pull this back.\u201d I usually would write an editorial note.Simple, right?If you were going to be running TechCrunch for the next couple of years, how would you manage those two things?Or the job of TechCrunch, I should say.\u201cSteve Jobs as editor\u201d-type thing, if you want to go there.She was at TechCrunch.And then we get to talking and you\u2019re like, I could see that it was weighing on you, that there were things you wanted to do that Verizon or AOL or whatever random owner TechCrunch had at the minute was just not going to let you do.But then...Did TechCrunch participate in that more or less as time went on?And we started covering them and OpenAI in 2014, or \u201915, \u201916, you know.And we\u2019d be like, \u201cNo, just because it\u2019s a big audience doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re just going to do whatever thing that you think is going to happen here.Founders without PR teams that are just coming to chat about this thing that they\u2019re doing that they\u2019re super hyped about.All of these things are functioning businesses.When you\u2019re that deep into the architecture of any system like that, extricating yourself takes time.So he knows exactly the value of what TechCrunch has for the industry.Ah, yes.That\u2019s the regret.I think they\u2019re profitable.I didn\u2019t begrudge them.Matt, I have to say I\u2019m happy we\u2019re still going to be friends, but it has been great having you as a friend and a competitor this past decade.And I 100 percent credit that to, well, I will take some small credit in that I was happy to spend the sweat and blood that it took to protect it over time.It varied, one a week for a long time.So I technically took over as editor-in-chief, full editor-in-chief, in 2015, but was really co-editing running it \u2014 making similar kinds of decisions, just in tandem, obviously \u2014 since January 2014.How do you see that?The thing that will be pivotal to this, and this is her job now, thankfully, is to make sure that she has alignment all the way up to the top of the business stack, to the CEO, that if TechCrunch\u2019s job is to do original reporting and tell people about things they\u2019ve never heard about, which has always been a primary part of the job, if not the job, traffic has got to be part of the conversation.And this is not aggrandizement.That labor, I viewed as part of the job.It\u2019s the right audience.Let me help everybody.And then, long term, I don\u2019t know.Reaching out and finding our own stories.And by this, I mean the people above us.Over time, that is what happened to almost every AOL property save TechCrunch.And going into a place like TechCrunch, which already had its own momentum and reputation and all of this stuff was happening already.So you\u2019re closing in on a decade at the helm of TechCrunch, in one way or another?Like it\u2019s hard, and we\u2019ve done well over the years and we\u2019ve grown significantly, which is a testament to everybody\u2019s ability on the TechCrunch staff to get people excited about this thing they\u2019ve never heard of \u2014 or at least help them to understand that they should be interested in it.It kind of doesn\u2019t matter who.It used to be that TechCrunch would know about a thing, and then 18 months later, everybody else would know.It can definitely ride on their whims.The site was founded by Mike Arrington, who minted a generation of writers who went on to become VCs.And the publication was geared around really one person or one set of attitudes.We don\u2019t have to rehash it.You need to understand what they do, what they don\u2019t do, how deep they go, what the capabilities are, what the possibilities are.\u201d But we don\u2019t put any AI-generated words on TechCrunch, period, nor do we even use them to generate story ideas or headlines or any of that stuff.Unfortunately, most people don\u2019t want to hear that the appropriate way is a lot of people.Our distribution platforms are upending themselves left and right.Storytelling is super important to an early company or any company.And even if they get to a few months old, or even a few minutes old, if you\u2019re telling people something they don\u2019t know, and they come to you as a primary source, who cares whatever AI does with it after that?We\u2019ve competed for scoops, we\u2019ve traded criticisms, and we\u2019ve asked each other for advice in running our publications and managing our teams.And my job, I felt, was to give them ownership over the things that were important at TechCrunch.Would I read it?How do you give access to that information to everyone?Right?If that sounds complicated, that\u2019s not even the half of it.How are we going to turn an enormous 10,000-person in-person event into a virtual one?So I wanted to have you on to talk about that run.And then the part that I focused on unplugging and altering was exactly what you said: that a large part of TechCrunch was built around being a vehicle for Mike, which is fine.This is the editorial process, right?It\u2019s an interesting choice that they go through to figure out why they\u2019re choosing not to talk to press or why they\u2019re choosing not to have somebody else tell their narrative.And you have to be.Thank you.Very specific audience.It\u2019s a decade old.If you get funded by a16z, they\u2019re going to provide you with all of the growth experts you need.Find the audience.That makes sense.How do we generate that?Oh, sorry.That\u2019s not a bad thing.I mean, not completely, but you know what I mean; it\u2019s rare.And that\u2019s an exhaustion thing sometimes; the best reporters can fall victim to that and be susceptible to that.So skepticism, not cynicism.That kind of thing happens with stories on the pages of The Verge, TechCrunch, the Times, other places like that, that\u2019s what brings the excitement.That has always been the dynamic there.And the early TechCrunch was a spray and pray of press releases almost.I would love to kind of create something or help somebody create something that is fresh and that I think is clever.Honestly, I like Tim Armstrong.What happens when everyone gets their news from TikTok?It was an interesting time when I was being recruited to join there.They viewed editing as a job as putting things in the right package.Yeah, depending on how you slice the pie, it\u2019s been about 10 years since I joined, and then a couple of months shy of 10 years since I became head of the pack there.Like, if your job is to generate attention, then something people already know about that they\u2019re searching for more information about is an easy win on the traffic front.It\u2019s all meat space all the way down, for now anyway.As big as YC\u2019s gotten, it can\u2019t fund everybody, and it can\u2019t bring everybody into its network, nor does it choose to.TechCrunch is a functioning, working business that is great, that works well.Whatever the form that took, we knew that it was going to be happening at the edges and continued to be happening at the edges.What\u2019s the next thing you\u2019re going to do?It\u2019s just the most important thing.TechCrunch Plus is making more and more money every day, which is great.People that genuinely go to sleep thinking about something, wake up thinking about it, and are willing to put in the effort to be at the point of inflection with their audience constantly.Then AOL bought it, and then there was some drama, and then Arrington left, and you all took over.I will speak on a trend basis.The company is called X now, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard.But then, the bulk of the programming everywhere else, besides that stage, was about setting the tone for what is going to be happening over the next 12 to 18 months.I went to a hackathon or I was milling about in a bar, and I was talking with some engineers, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, we heard of this new technology or this new programming language called Ruby, and these guys are putting together a package to make it faster.\u2019 And then, 12 months later, this is the first big company that has Ruby at its base.\u201d\n\nNow, you\u2019re lucky if you get a few weeks.Our whole job is to go inward more.You mentioned stuff people are searching for.How do you balance TechCrunch\u2019s role?However, if I were to, say, run media company XYZ, and I was trying to determine what my path would be forward, I think niche media is going to be the thing that survives this next burst of energy.But that was the ethos.And I don\u2019t mean fear in some sort of weird way.And so I was willing to sort of put in that sweat.It is a firmament of the startup ecosystem.I mean, he founded the thing; it was his thing.We\u2019re the people you trust.Let me figure this out.And it can be that a valid choice is we\u2019re going to tell our own story and not let anybody else ever tell it.And then, the flip side of that I see from my vantage point running a large outlet is, oh you kind of need a story to validate some of what you\u2019re saying.I think there\u2019s a lot of value in those.It\u2019s a good time to talk to somebody about this stuff, especially someone who\u2019s about to walk away.Thanks for coming on.Are we not being proactive enough?It\u2019s just so quick now.That drama is why a bunch of us left AOL and started The Verge.It\u2019s like, oh, ChatGPT is a thing.My byword for Disrupt, as an example, has always been \u2014 when we\u2019re doing programming \u2014 \u201ctoo soon.\u201d How do we get people to talk about stuff that they\u2019re doing too soon?I don\u2019t know.But you basically put out these memos and these notes and have live discussions with your people that help you to tweak that mix and tweak that balance of, \u201cOkay, are we being too access-driven on this?Go direct.It was the \u201cbozo\u201d explosion, right?We\u2019re here.And I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right or wrong.You\u2019re gone now.There wasn\u2019t some Machiavellian thing behind it, besides the fact that I knew we had a lot of really great talent.You have to just build your sense of taste over time as the fire hose got larger and larger.Who cares?And then I just want to talk about, now that you have a bit of a remove, what you think happens next.The media business has, for years now, been beholden to social platforms and search engines, but it\u2019s facing a new existential threat from generative AI.However, advertising revenue is important to a publication in this current environment.That branding itself tells a story because I think, initially, we viewed this as extra TechCrunch.That\u2019s what\u2019s next for me immediately.I think people value focused information from obsessives.You know, I like to help people to flourish in an environment that they feel comfortable so they can be creative.They cover Congress via newsletter, like what happened in the halls of Congress today.That was fine by me, right?I appreciate it.We have to get our branding correct.I don\u2019t really consider myself an advocate of thriving in chaos.And it\u2019s really crazy, the speed of the loop between the time that something is nascent or weird or interesting and the time that it\u2019s everywhere is so quick.The mix of editorial content \u2014 from \u201cthis is a funding story\u201d to \u201cthis is a growth story\u201d to \u201cthis is a story of something gone awry.\u201d Those dials are always twiddleable.Right now, the senior leadership of TechCrunch that I\u2019m leaving behind at the top has like a hundred years of TechCrunch experience.Because that always felt very difficult to do standalone journalism but then also be so deeply enmeshed in the industry as one of its most important elements.It was not like some sort of theological anti-AI thing.And so, they\u2019re a little bit about the architecture of venture but then also important industries like climate tech and sustainability and that sort of thing.It is exhausting work, but it\u2019s also exciting work if it\u2019s the thing you\u2019re truly obsessed with.Honestly, I don\u2019t know \u2014 it\u2019s not like I have any sort of theological thing.But the regrets that I do have are all the things we could have done.You only have to look back a couple of years.In media, or not in media?They\u2019re like, \u201cAh, what will they write about us?And then talk about what you think happens now.We\u2019ve solved a bunch of the same problems in different ways, which is always interesting to compare and contrast.There\u2019s never any feeling of penalizing anybody for making that choice.It\u2019s always dials, right?This is not a pantomime.And boy, is there a lot of chaos when it comes to TechCrunch.Oh yeah, storytelling.\u201d Storytelling: that\u2019s the buzzword.TechCrunch Disrupt is one of the most notable events in the entire startup calendar every year.I\u2019m sure Connie\u2019s going to do great as well, but it\u2019s been great hanging out with you and talking shop a little bit.That\u2019s fun, do it.I think taste comes into a lot of that.Why not have these great people and use them to their fullest?You need to understand them, right?You\u2019ll hear us talk about how TechCrunch has grown from what was once the singular extension of Mike Arrington to a much broader brand that remains indispensable to the startup community.My clock\u2019s ticking.\u201d\n\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems.\u00a0Subscribe\u00a0here!It felt a little bit weird going into that because I was like, \u201cWho am I to come into this and make a space for myself and then eventually lead the place?\u201d\n\nAnd so, the way I looked at it is, I wanted to try to retain a lot of the things that I felt that Mike had established that were really good.My friend Casey Newton is fond of saying that anybody can get traffic, and it is impossible to build an audience.If I didn\u2019t do it, if I said yes, they would have just rolled right over the rest of it.Are you saying basically you\u2019ve gotten to the point where you\u2019re comfortable in this time?Raising their individual profiles is part of it, but Disrupt certainly, giving them more onstage time, help having them pitch in on programming and own those asks and interviews all the way to fruition.And it is forward-looking.But if you want to emphasize original reporting, you have to by nature understand that original means new, and new generally means you have to convince people to be interested.One of the most interesting things about the TechCrunch story, it actually interlocks with The Verge story in many ways.Then Verizon realized it shouldn\u2019t be in the media business and sold the whole deal to a private equity company called Apollo Global, which put former Tinder CEO Jim Lanzone in charge.I personally have published AI-generated copy onto The Verge.It can ride on trend thinking among PR professionals and comms professionals, the people whose responsibility it is to build the narrative of the company from inside the company.And there were so many of those.That\u2019s two trends that are just, those are freight trains pointed at each other.The average is 18 months, right?Oh, 100 percent.I\u2019ll just tell the audience: a long time ago, I tried to hire you to come work at The Verge when you were at The Next Web.And I am, just to be really clear, the current owners of TechCrunch are actually really smart and understand the value of it.How do we unlock the expertise and individual knowledge and really nitty-gritty, grindy stuff for them with a small (relatively speaking) subscription fee that can give them so much more information about the way this world works?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur ambitions [were] ... severely curtailed by the fact that the various owners of TechCrunch over the years didn\u2019t really want to invest in it in the ways that we wanted to.\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s your grandma or whether it\u2019s your brother or cousin or nephew or parents.And that\u2019s what a lot of these places lacked.Were you using any AI tools in the TechCrunch newsroom, ChatGPT to do drafts, the things that other people are doing?Matthew Panzarino, you are the former editor-in-chief of TechCrunch \u2014 and also notably a good friend of mine.And people would have left.One of my pithy sayings, which my writers will probably groan if they listen to this podcast \u2014 which I don\u2019t advise they do, they\u2019ve heard all this before \u2014 but one of my pithy sayings is that TechCrunch needs to stand close enough to the fire to feel the heat but not close enough to be hypnotized by the flames.It was a ferocious independent publication for a long time.Tell your own story.So I joined in late 2013 and took over as co-editor in January 2014.People are doing different things.I can do it.\u201d And there\u2019s a reset, you know, \u201cNo, hold on.They haven\u2019t raised any more capital after their initial raise.As an EIC, I think a lot of times it is dependent on the type of personality that you have as a person.That\u2019s true.You know, The Verge and your run at TechCrunch have been in parallel for a long time.Our view is, what are we selling?And there\u2019s a lot of wreckage in the ravine over the past decade in media.I would see you at events and you\u2019d be like, \u201cI don\u2019t know, man.We\u2019re selling us.I wanted to make sure that they were able to see the fruits of their labors when it came time for Disrupt or even editorial story selection.So traffic has always been tough, right?Audiences are different.And then, I would say, a couple of years ago, you started telling me that you were going to go.A lot of really good people.I want to build something new.It\u2019s not like I would object, but I think maybe I want to try out something a little different for a while.Like every one of us is, right?It\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m so happy to be in this moment stepping away because it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, finally, people that get it.\u201d Because there were a lot of previous owners of this.\u201cHey, you\u2019re not going to stop us from writing about you.\u201d\n\nThe Times can do that, right?So I want to talk about TechCrunch a bunch and just get a sense of where you\u2019re leaving this institution.But ironically, TechCrunch is in the business of writing about things nobody\u2019s ever heard about.I think he\u2019s a great salesman and a really smart guy.And that\u2019s just the way that it works now is that it\u2019s five to 10 people that really obsess about a thing that run a several million-dollar business about X and that\u2019s it.That is tiresome work.But the fact is, at some point, your narrative will become the property of the public, of other people.It was one of those things.We\u2019ve got to talk about this as, like, \u201cHey, traffic may grow slower, it may be lower, it may be whatever, but we\u2019ll provide value in these other ways.\u201d\n\nBecause Disrupt makes money.Like there\u2019s always another crisis, right?And then it also has Disrupt, where there\u2019s a competitive element and showing up on that stage and doing well is really important.I don\u2019t really care.So that meant continuity, continuity of understanding what TechCrunch was, what it is, what its role is, the balance, as you mentioned before, between getting snowblown by all these smart, young, brazen people building technology and also yet saying, but we retain optimism.But I was only able to do it really because we have a long \u2014 unusually long \u2014 tenured team.But the architectures around those things, remember, were being pushed and pulled by these billion-dollar flips, these acquisitions by much larger corporations, to which TechCrunch was essentially a drop of sweat rolling off the back of an animal.We\u2019ve been swept into the same bucket many times over the years of \u201cthe media just doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d Like that kind of universe.And honestly, nobody was malicious.It\u2019s not like it had any really hateful relationships.You know, I think one of the only reasons it didn\u2019t happen to us is because we were willing to sort of leverage their fear, I guess, is the word.But the fact is people come around.How did you get here?I think that is the power of that.The covid thing, there are acquisitions, there\u2019s been three, you know, it\u2019s constant pushes of the reset button, where I\u2019m like, \u201cCool, cool.Today, I\u2019m talking with Matthew Panzarino, the former editor-in-chief of TechCrunch.I would say what you and I talk about the most over time is fighting off weird, trendy shit.Like, what will they say about us if we make them do this?\u201d And I was happy to utilize that.Skating that edge literally is our job.And that has just dramatically changed over time.They know that we grok that, but we have not been wholly immune.TechCrunch is a fixture.TechCrunch is \u2014 you\u2019ve done a few things that are different.I remember talking to you about it at launch.I\u2019m not saying people would have just said, \u201cYeah, okay, yeah, whatever,\u201d but it would have ruined the thing that existed.It\u2019s crazy to think that.Eventually, we wanted to grow, obviously, to be more.Yeah, it has.They kind of set the tone for this universe.\u201d In some ways, it\u2019s always reflective as well.They went through a whole era of spinning up their own publications because they wanted to go direct.They wanted to invest in it in weird, trendy ways\u201d\n\nEven if they live in Ohio or India or wherever else, they can unlock the knowledge that it takes to build companies and scale companies and do this with a relatively small investment without having access to the networks that drive a lot of this information.That has always been the dynamic there.The value of narrative is a weird one because almost anybody that you talk to will be willing to ascribe a lot of value to it.I think they view this as a growth opportunity for TechCrunch.But in fact, editing is all about taste and curating, like a curatorial force.It\u2019s like, you mentioned Disrupt, like the [Startup] Battlefield is exciting because it\u2019s actually real.This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.And that\u2019s about as far as I\u2019ve taken the thought.As a publication, you can be very easily seduced by, \u201cIf I feed this audience, I can feed them anything.I certainly hear it from VCs all the time.It\u2019s probably one of the last real startup competitions on the planet.Matt talks a lot about balancing TechCrunch\u2019s editorial responsibilities with the role it plays in that community helping promote up-and-coming companies and the ebb and flow of Silicon Valley\u2019s relationship with a site like TechCrunch.This is not patting ourselves on the back.And the extra TechCrunch was what job could we do for readers that was essentially self-funded by the reader.I just put a lot of words around it saying, \u201cLook at this garbage.\u201d I can\u2019t get anybody to be outraged about it.It\u2019s literal.You have to constantly have your hands on the dial 24/7.I think you told me that the first product that clicked for you was reviews of office furniture companies because there was just none of this information out in the world.One of the things that I would call out in the past decade is going direct.However, when it comes time to fund media or invest in media or understand that the expense of media is almost wholly people \u2014 if you look at the P&L of a media organization, the top-line expense is always people, unless you\u2019re doing something funky and trying something new.Because it is true that over the years I\u2019ve seen you, often at events, we\u2019ve been excited to do our jobs because covering the events is maybe the best part of the job.There\u2019s always another foundation-level crisis coming around the bend.My feeling is the people who are loudest about saying that are the people who are talking to us the most, by the way.The event that brings together the most influential voices in tech is back for 2023.Michael Arrington obviously started TechCrunch.It doesn\u2019t matter; you get the logo.It absolutely did limit, I think, the fun bits for me.We\u2019ve definitely put some stuff out there but obviously clearly labeled and really specifically about like, this is what we\u2019re writing about.They were like, \u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d But at the same time, the brand halo was super strong.That\u2019s one shape I could see it taking.Mike eventually sold the site to AOL, which then sold itself to Verizon, which bought Yahoo and merged AOL and Yahoo together.It was just like, \u201cNo, our job is to write the stuff, so we\u2019re gonna write the stuff.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll end it here.I read her note.There are good people in place.Stepping in there, I viewed it as my responsibility and my job not to replace Mike with myself and say, \u201cOkay cool, now I\u2019m the new center of the TechCrunch world and all of this.\u201d Instead, a) Mike\u2019s irreplaceable, a very unique individual and b) I had all of these really great smart people that had been bleeding out for TechCrunch over these last few years in and among the chaos.She\u2019s going to be the new editor-in-chief.Let\u2019s start with TechCrunch.",

Microsoft case show Microsoft's head of gaming Phil Spencer admitting that the Starfield delay was a bad situation for the company's Xbox Game Pass lineup.As Eurogamer reports, in an email sent in May 2022 to colleagues, Spencer called the delay of Bethesda's sci-fi RPG a \"disaster situation\", and said that the lack of clarity on the launch date for Redfall and Stalker 2 at the time - the latter of which has been impacted by the ongoing war in Ukraine - left \"a huge hole with our games lineup both for platform marketing/differentiation and our Game Pass content\".\"He went on to say that he thinks Microsoft and the team should get better at portfolio planning for its games with \"real honesty on dates\" after setting \"a very high bar in 2021 on quality and pacing\", but going into 2022 with no big exclusives launching \"is a portfolio planning miss that we can't afford\".\"We keep talking about a [big] AAA a quarter [sic] in the service [Game Pass] and it feels like we are likely to go through a gap of almost 16 months between big exclusive launches on our platform,\" Spencer said.Will do.",

experience \u2013 unleashing personal productivity and creativity through the power of the cloud and PC working together,\u201d he said.The MCM design will be backed by Intel's Foveros packaging technology, which is the same chip-bonding technology that went into the ill-fated Lakefield chip that powered some low-power mobile devices that were poorly received, and so was quickly put into End of Life.While there were many issues with the Lakefield chip other than the Foveros packaging that kept it from being successful, the Core Ultra chips represent a major design shift for Intel's processors, bigger even than its move to a hybrid-core architecture with Intel Alder Lake back in 2022, so Intel is putting a lot of faith in this tech to power its future chip development.Bringing AI applications into the personal computer(Image credit: Intel)A major part of this Year's Intel Innovations conference this year is an update to Intel's distribution of the OpenVINO AI toolkit, which provides developers a common language to use when building out AI applications and will leverage the new Intel hardware.While we haven't gotten to see the chips for ourselves yet, the improved GPU alone could help make these the best processors of 2023, especially for more budget-friendly systems that don't need a dedicated graphics card.The Core Ultra is the company's first consumer CPU to feature a multi chiplet module (MCM) design.Intel's latest 2023.1 version of the toolkit is optimized to utilize the NPU in the Intel Core Ultra processor, which Intel and developers hope will in turn make practical development of AI applications for PCs with Core Ultra chips both easier and more appealing for both developers and consumers.\u201cWe\u2019ve been co-developing with Intel teams a suite of Acer AI applications to take advantage of the Intel Core Ultra platform,\u201d Jerry Kao, chief operating officer of Acer said during the keynote, \u201cdeveloping with the OpenVINO toolkit and co-developed AI libraries to bring the hardware to life.\u201dTo show what Intel's Core Ultra could do, Kao demonstrated an Acer Swift laptop running an Intel Core Ultra chip running a Stable Diffusion generative AI-powered app that took a basic photo of a ballerina and generated a whole new image from it, locally, and created a parallaxing desktop wallpaper with it in under a minute.Generative AI and multimedia uses immediately come to mind, as do device personalization, settings controls, and others that have already started cropping up on Windows PCs in recent years, but which haven't had specialized hardware to power them.Taking a cue from Apple's playbookThe Intel Core Ultra may be the first chip from Team Blue that introduces an NPU, but it's not the first processor on the market to do so.Intel announced its newest processors, the Intel Core Ultra series, during the Intel Innovation keynote on Tuesday, which it says will usher in the age of the \"AI PC\" later this year when the chip hits the market.The new Intel processors, codenamed Meteor Lake, will be the company's first chips for the consumer market to feature a dedicated neural processing unit (NPU), which will power AI-driven workloads for consumers, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said during the opening keynote of the Intel Innovation conference in San Jose, California.This design uses two or more silicon slices\u2014which contain the transistors that power a computer, called dies\u2014that are bonded together at a microscopic level to allow for more flexible chip development than is possible with a single slab of monolithic silicon companies have used in the past.If nothing else, it's something genuinely new from Intel, so it'll be exciting to see how it all plays out once we get the chips in our hands.That honor would go to Apple, which introduced a neural engine into its A11 Bionic chip back in 2017, and later its Apple M1 Chip in 2020.These chips, especially on mobile devices, have helped power some remarkable advances in the area of photography and video on the best iPhones, but there hasn't really been a groundbreaking \"killer app\" for these consumer chips yet the way the best graphics cards from Nvidia, as well as its more industrial-strength AI hardware, has powered the generative AI revolution behind ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and others.Still, Intel getting into the NPU game is a smart move, and with the OpenVINO toolkit, there's a lot of incentive for the broad base of developers coding for Intel hardware to find new and practical uses for this NPU.\u201cWe are ushering in a new age of the AI PC.\u201d(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)Along with the NPU and what Intel claims will be impressively \"power-efficient performance\" thanks to advanced 7nm Intel 4 process technology, Intel's new chip series will bring an enhanced integrated GPU powered by Intel Arc graphics architecture.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Tap here for larger image or pinch to zoom.Instead of a single CPU or display region of the chip, each Meteor Lake has two \u2014 one on a \u201clow power island\u201d that can theoretically run all by itself, with its own efficiency CPU core, NPU AI coprocessor, media engine, and memory.The low power island is \u201cideal for an entire class of workloads that care about the lowest power,\u201d says Intel\u2019s Tim Wilson, VP of the design engineering group.The fine print reads: \u201cIntel Arc graphics only available on select MTL processor-powered systems with dual-channel memory.\u201d\n\nAI guaranteed?Image: Intel\n\nThat goes for the AI coprocessor, too \u2014 which Windows can natively see and monitor in the Task Manager, by the way.Meteor Lake will \u201claunch\u201d on December 14th, the company now says, as the most power-efficient client processor the company\u2019s ever made \u2014 and with up to twice the graphics performance, a \u201clow power island\u201d that can run tasks independently, and hooks into Microsoft Windows to intelligently control the new chips.Image: Intel\n\nIntel says the \u201cXe LPG\u201d GPU offers up to twice the performance per watt of Xe LP, which themselves were twice the performance per watt of its 11th Gen Intel UHD that came integrated in processors before.Image: Intel\n\nIn addition to AV1 video, native HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1 support, and either 8K HDR video or up to four 4K monitors at once, that SoC tile offers Bluetooth 5.4 and Wi-Fi 7.In no particular order, here are the highlights of Intel\u2019s Core Ultra \u2014 because yeah, this one\u2019s not called a Core i7.\u201cAn example of this is the addition of hardware support for the AV1 film grain feature, which was previously executed with GPU shaders,\u201d writes Intel.This slide drops a hint that we\u2019re still talking about a 28W part.Image: Intel\n\nNone of this matters if the components don\u2019t actually perform, and Intel\u2019s said nothing about raw performance or battery life in response to our questions.But all those \u201cgraphics\u201d-like tasks separate from GPU doesn\u2019t mean the GPU is just for show.It\u2019s putting $3.5 billion into New Mexico through next year and $7 billion into Penang, Malaysia, over the next 10 years to invest in a \u201csharp ramp in capacity\u201d for Meteor Lake and other Foveros-style chips \u2014 the ones that three-dimensionally stack and assemble different building block chips onto a single package.The graphics are on TSMC\u2019s 5nm process, and the I/O and new \u201cSoC Tile\u201d are on TSMC N6.You can actually see the heterogeneity if you look closely \u2014 the tiles look like puzzle pieces.Intel\u2019s NPU in Windows Task Manager.Intel says Meteor Lake can add its Intel Arc graphics \u2014 now with dedicated ray-tracing units and up to 8 Xe cores on the chip itself.For many months, Intel has spared no opportunity to remind us that its Meteor Lake chips would be the ones to watch \u2014 its first CPU with different chiplets for each component; its first on its Intel 4 process node; its first with a dedicated AI coprocessor inside.And it\u2019s doing so by taking some of the \u201cCentral\u201d out of CPU.The company says yields of the Intel 4 parts of Meteor Lake (read: the Compute Tile) outstrip not only its introductions of 14nm with Broadwell and 10nm with Ice Lake but also its \u201ctock\u201d refinements to the \u201ctick tock\u201d formula with Skylake and Tiger Lake, respectively.Reps repeatedly apologized on a conference call, saying they\u2019d answer those sorts of questions closer to launch.Next, it\u2019s moving to direct copper-to-copper bonding, something it\u2019s calling Foveros Direct, and it intends to sit these chips on glass by the end of the decade.They also support Intel\u2019s XeSS \u2014 its intelligent upscaler akin to Nvidia\u2019s DLSS and AMD\u2019s FSR \u2014 for the first time on integrated graphics, which could help boost frame rates even more.Can it game?3D performance hybrid architecture is a fancy catchphrase for \u201cnot all these things need to be turned on at once.\u201d Image: Intel\n\nRealistically, most people using a computer will invoke the Compute Tile, but Intel wants to heat up the chip as little as it can, with an enhanced \u201cThread Director\u201d that only pushes work to higher-power cores after it\u2019s tried the lowest-power ones first:\n\nIntel\u2019s Thread Director.Image: Intel\n\nAnd Intel has developed its own \u201cpatented low-cost vapor chamber\u201d cooling solution, the company claims, to help get gamer and creator laptops with Meteor Lake out in the world.Image: Intel\n\nSince \u201cMedia\u201d is separated from \u201cGraphics,\u201d integrated encoding and decoding of video could theoretically happen without hitting the graphics tile at all.But the NPU \u2014 that AI coprocessor \u2014 should theoretically be in every chip.Instead, it\u2019s suggesting that you now have options \u2014 it\u2019s much more efficient to let the NPU run image generator Stable Diffusion, and it\u2019s faster and still decently more efficient to have your GPU and NPU run it together:\n\nImage: Intel\n\nThe company didn\u2019t seem to have a lot of specific examples for how \u201cAI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows,\u201d to borrow a phrase from Microsoft\u2019s out-the-door Windows boss Panos Panay \u2014 at least beyond the same things Qualcomm\u2019s NPUs can already do with Windows Studio Effects in Microsoft Teams.\u201cThe NPU will be available across the full product stack of Meteor Lake,\u201d says Intel\u2019s Tim Wilson, VP of architecture.It\u2019s made of tiles\n\nWith Meteor Lake, Intel will join its peers in crafting computer chips out of Lego-like building blocks \u2014 where the \u201cCPU\u201d and \u201cGPU\u201d aren\u2019t just separate components on the same chip, for example, but actually separate pieces of silicon printed at different sizes and grafted together.On the CPU side, the only hints I saw were that the new Crestmont E-cores have unspecified \u201cIPC gains over previous E-cores\u201d \u2014 though results may vary, the fine print warns \u2014 and that the new Redwood Cove P-cores have \u201cimproved performance efficiency.\u201d\n\nImage: Intel\n\nBut Intel says it\u2019s investing big in this model of the future.There\u2019s nothing like labeled axes.Image: Intel\n\nThe other processor cores are distributed among a \u201cCompute Tile\u201d on Intel 4 that houses the P (Performance) and E (Efficiency) cores, dubbed Redwood Cove and Crestmont, respectively, plus a separate Graphics Tile on TSMC N5.More companies should try them!Right out of the gate, no pun intended, Intel is attempting to use chiplets to radically reduce how much power its processors draw.The likes of AMD and Qualcomm have been doing this for a while, but heterogeneous computing is relatively new to Intel.(That would line up with what Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a July earnings call: \u201cWe\u2019re going to build AI into every platform we build.\u201d But I haven\u2019t confirmed if Meteor Lake will appear outside Core Ultra, so buying a non-Ultra chip may mean no NPU for now.)But the upside is that companies can choose the best building blocks \u2014 and selectively cut off power to the rest.Image: Intel\n\nJust know that not every Meteor Lake / Core Ultra processor will get the fancy GPU.Intel isn\u2019t suggesting the tiny NPU will suddenly mean generative AI can stop running on giant cloud servers filled with Nvidia H100 chips, nor is the company saying this one NPU can do it all while you sleep.Today, Intel is revealing a whole lot more.The latter theoretically offers up to 5.76Gbps transfer speeds, assuming you manage to set up a 320MHz channel in your workplace or neighborhood.Photo: Intel\n\nThe downside for you is that only part of Intel\u2019s chip is actually on the company\u2019s bleeding-edge Intel 4 process.But it does have an OpenVINO Inference Engine to help talk to those applications and pipe them directly to the NPU, and a lot of general ideas, including:\n\nImage: Intel\n\nIntel is using Meteor Lake as proof that it\u2019s executing again, as part of Gelsinger\u2019s grand turnaround plan for the company.Image: Intel\n\nWhile it didn\u2019t provide any performance numbers, Intel says the GPU can \u201crun at a much lower minimum voltage and reach a much higher maximum clock speed\u201d than previous iGPUs, at well over 2GHz.",

            "paraphrased_content": "My setup is on the darker side of things usually due to an aging light bulb and lampshade, but this light bar made an immediate difference in illuminating my surroundings.I found that the RGB was the most prominent with the room light turned off and relying on the light bar itself to keep me illuminated.Instead of the older Litra Glow, a small square-shaped light that attaches to the monitor, the Beam LX comes with its own stand and can be both horizontally and vertically mounted.This means you can have it under your monitor, above your displays, or stood up in between depending on how much space is available on your gaming setup.If you\u2019re someone who\u2019s in need of a more powerful light than what USB ports on your PC can handle then you\u2019re in good hands here.The Logitech Litra Beam LX is the next iteration of the brand\u2019s gaming light bar aimed at streamers.Design and features(Image credit: Future)As far as key lights go, the Logitech Litra Beam LX is among the best-designed models that I\u2019ve used.The RGB lighting itself is vivid and the controls mean you can cycle through gradients, primary colors, and rainbow spectrums.The big difference here from the prior version is the RGB lighting as this is a dual-sided light.(Image credit: Future)VerdictBuy it if\u2026 \u00a0You want a powerful desktop key light\u00a0The Litra Beam LX is one of the brightest and most powerful key lights I have ever used.The stand that comes with the Litra Beam LX is excellent as you can either mount horizontally or vertically and adjust the height to several mounting points.You\u2019re able to use it with Lightsync through Logitech\u2019s G Hub, and there\u2019s Bluetooth functionality to control the lighting wirelessly as well.Fortunately, the temperature controls on the Litra Beam LX are easy to cycle through as swapping from a colder blue hue to a warmer orange tint only takes around a second or two.As someone who has previously used the Litra Glow as a key light in the past, this one is a definitive upgrade in terms of its brightness.For comparison, the original Litra Beam currently sells for $99 / \u00a399 (around AU$150), so you\u2019re paying about 50% for the added RGB ambient lighting.The top of the Litra Beam LX houses all the controls if you just want to configure things without having to utilize a PC.You\u2019ve got a power button, brightness control, and color temperature gauge, the latter of which doubles as an RGB color toggle when the switch is engaged.Price and availabilityThe Logitech Litra Beam LX launched on September 19 in countries such as the US and the UK and retails for $149 (approximately \u00a3120 / AU$230).It builds on the foundations of the original model by adding ambient RGB lighting for a competitive price point.The overall temperature range of 2700-6500K is balanced, as even the most intense setting was easy on the eyes.Much like the original Litra Beam, the LX version is mains-powered and this has been done in order to make it considerably brighter than the previous USB-powered Glow model.It effectively doubles as both a ring light and RGB light strip in one, and the included stands mean you have a lot of different mounting options to suit your setup.The company claims the 400-lumen LEDs are \u201cTrueSoft for natural, radiant skin tones\u201d and in my testing, I can confirm this.Essentially, it aims to be both mood-lighting and a ring light in one.However, if you\u2019re solely interested in a light bar without this feature, then the original, far cheaper Litra Beam, may be a better choice.Don\u2019t buy it if\u2026 \u00a0You don't need or want RGB lightingYou\u2019re better off buying the standard Litra Beam if you want to get the best value for money as it is considerably cheaper.You want a USB-powered ring light\u00a0The Litra Beam LX requires mains power to function, so if you just want something to plug into the USB port of your PC then the Litra Glow is the better choice here.It\u2019s not quite as powerful as the front-facing beam in terms of raw brightness, with a softer ambiance, but it does a good job of reaching the wall behind my monitors.Complete your setup with one of the best gaming monitors and pair it with one of the best PC controllers.Performance (Image credit: Future)The first thing that surprised me about the Logitech Litra Beam LX is just how bright it is when plugged in.It\u2019s all very intuitive and straightforward, meaning you can make quick adjustments if it's in reach, and then fine-tune in the software if needed.If you\u2019re looking to step your streaming gear up, it\u2019s a good choice to pair with some of the best webcams and one of the best green screens.Ultimately, the Logitech Litra Beam LX is a great key light that features decent RGB lighting.You want RGB lighting in your setup \n\nThe RGB on the reverse of the Litra Beam is bright and adds a soft ambiance to the setup without being overkill.For those darker times, a warmer color is a better option, though, as staring into harsh white light at all hours of the night wasn\u2019t quite ideal.However, you\u2019re paying a premium on this added feature over the original, so if RGB is something you can live without then you\u2019re better off going for the standard variant instead.",

of which there are six to choose from - have been infused into the glass and the result is a very, light shade of colour.During my time with the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, I didn't encounter any slowdown, whether I was running high-end apps or being an internet power user in Firefox.Almost all the reviews that we have seen talk about how the new phones are honestly much better offerings this time around as compared to last year.The phones will be available in-store and in all online retailers starting 22nd September, later this week.However, this likely won't matter to the iPhone 15's audience.Would I prefer Apple to stick with including its most powerful chip in all of its new smartphones?That is the same time when the devices will be available in retail stores, but the good news is that if you were waiting for the reviews, now is the time because reviews from major outlets are out, and well, we have some good news for those who have been thinking whether or not they should upgrade.And hey, you can now use the same charging cable as your Android-toting friends and loved ones, which will certainly come in handy at some point.Everyone who has been waiting to get their hands on the new iPhone 15\u00a0series will be getting the devices on 22nd September.This change has been a long time coming, and I applaud it, even if Apple is literally years late to doing so.Now that we are done looking at the written reviews of the new iPhones, let's look at what some of our favorite tech YouTubers have to say about the new phones.MKBHD\n\nCNET\n\nUrAvgConsumer\n\nBrian Tong\n\nWell, there you have it, folks.[...]\nFlip the iPhone 15 onto its silky soft matte back and you'll notice some big changes to the front.The biggest update is that the iPhone 15 has the ability to capture both 24-megapixel and 48-megapixel images, which can be preset under \"Resolution Control\" in your phone's camera settings.The new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus also saw some camera improvements, with the new 48-megapixel camera being one of them.You probably won't though, because it will be the lack of notch at the top of the display that will likely capture your attention first.Definitely, especially as the promise of console-level gaming looms on with the iPhone 15 Pro and its A17 Pro chip, while the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are stuck with the A16.The iPhone 15 now has an additional 2X optical zoom option, whereas the iPhone 14 only offered .5 and 1X zooms.Portrait mode on iPhone 15 can be activated automatically when the camera detects a portrait-worthy image, though in my experience, the iPhone 15 has yet to deem any of my subjects worthy of portraiture.But this feature is optimized for shooting at 1X in decent light, whereas if you shoot at .5X, or ultrawide, the camera will default back to 12-megapixel captures.Still, The Verge's Dan Seifert has a view of things to say.The iPhone 15 is generally a homerun as reviews talk about how Apple has made the right decision even with the standard models\nBoth the standard iPhone 15 models bring a number of design improvements, including the Dynamic Island.Pocket-Lint's Britta O'Boyle\u00a0 really likes the design of the new iPhone 15, and shares how,\nThere's a matte glass back in place of the coloured glossy finish we've been accustomed to since the iPhone XR and its vibrant, colourful back.If you have been thinking about getting your hands on the new iPhones, even the standard models, you know that you are in safe hands and you can get access to something truly amazing.Like the iPhone 15 Pro models, the rear of the iPhone 15 is almost soft-to-touch with a lovely smooth finish that makes this phone really rather delightful to hold - trust me on this.The iPhone 15 completely pivots on this design feature, opting for a much more subtle, pastel finish.You are also getting a USB-C port, the A16 Bionic CPU, a 48-megapixel primary camera, and a lot more.The new iPhones are also equipped with the new A16 Bionic chip that was first introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro devices, and while this might not sit well with some, MobileSyrup's Patrick O'Rourke thinks otherwise.Also, in Portrait mode, you can now control the depth of the image and zoom out to capture even more data from the scene.The new iPhone 15 does have a USB-C port, but sadly, it is limited to USB 2.0 speeds as opposed to USB 3.2 on the Pro models.It's not just the softness in colour that makes the iPhone 15 stand out though.",

session when you\u2019ve got these on.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)The Virtuoso Pro is also extremely customizable.(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)Coming in black and white colorways, the Corsair Virtuoso Pro doesn\u2019t stray very far from Corsair\u2019s signature look.Both Kendrick Lamar and SZA\u2019s All the Stars and Kavisky\u2019s Nightcall had good bass and even decent rumble.It\u2019s not all perfect, performance-wise, however.And, the overall build is as premium as Corsair\u2019s other high-end offerings.It\u2019s just as beautiful, in fact, as all of Corsair\u2019s recent gaming headset releases, especially in white.However, I can guarantee that it\u2019s worth the splurge over the competition - if you have the money to spend.That\u2019s especially because it is cheaper than both the wired SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro and the graphene-driver-fitted Logitech Pro X 2 Lightspeed, which sit at the top of the gaming headset pile in terms of performance and value.If you are ready to explore the world of open-back gaming headsets, however, and you just don\u2019t have that money to spare, I would look at some of Philips\u2019 offerings.My years of experience along with my discerning audio tastes make me more than qualified to test and vet these devices for you.Read more about how we testFirst reviewed September 2023The synths and highs in Taylor Swift\u2019s Bejeweled were bright and sparkly, and the ukelele in Florence and the Machine\u2019s Dog Days Are Over was bright and clear.There\u2019s plenty of bass as well.It\u2019s not in your face like other gaming headsets, but it has good low-end response, especially considering that it\u2019s an open-back headset.Speaking of detailed audio, the highs are incredible here, bright without being painful or fatiguing except in a handful of situations, and with lots of detail and clarity.(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)The one thing I don\u2019t like about the design is the fact that the mic, which is detachable, is attached to the dual 3.5mm audio cable that also attaches to the right earcup for audio.There will be some sibilance as well.It's more expensive than other open-back gaming headsets, but it's worth it.Don't buy it if...You prefer closed-back headsets\nIf you're not ready to jump on the open-back gaming headset bandwagon, you should skip this one... for now.You're on a tight budget\nIf you are ready to experience the joys of open-back but don't have the money, Philips

getting crisp and highly detailed sound, whether you're gaming, watching movies, or listening to music.Logitech Pro X 2 Lightspeed\nFitted with graphene drivers, the Logitech Pro X 2 Lightspeed delivers incredibly detailed audio with an amazing soundscape.In fact, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s a bit more expensive than offerings from Epos and Audio-Technica.They also tend to have brighter highs that deliver lots of details and clarity.It has me convinced.When playing Hogwarts Legacy, it was apparent that all the sound elements had clarity to them, and I could hear precisely where they were in the soundstage, resulting in a very immersive experience.However, your voice will come through a little compressed and harsh-sounding.(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)It helps that it has 50mm graphene drivers \u2013 similar to those in the Logitech Pro X 2 Lightspeed \u2013 that also contributes to its very detailed audio quality.And what an impressive first entry it is, effortlessly rising to the ranks of the best wired gaming headsets out there and so much so it might convince Corsair\u2019s rivals to make their own.So, it\u2019s kind of strange that not many gaming headset manufacturers are keen to jump on that bandwagon.Luckily, Corsair is making up for lost time with its bold new Corsair Virtuoso Pro, an open-back addition (its very first) to its already excellent gaming headset line, many of which are among the best gaming headsets on the market.Corsair isn\u2019t, of course, a pioneer in the open-back gaming headsets scene \u2013 Epos, Audio-Technica, and even Philips all got there first.The mids are a little pulled back, and since the high end is pushed forward, you\u2019re getting harsher guitars, which means that the sound can be unpleasant with rock songs.Now that I think about it, it\u2019s really the mic that\u2019s the Virtuoso Pro\u2019s weakest point, but more on that later.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)Despite those minor shortcomings, there\u2019s plenty to love about the gaming headset\u2019s design.I AB\u2019ed the two during testing, and my beloved Arctis Nova Pro now feels very confined next to it.$199.99 / \u00a3169.99 / AU$239\u00a0When is it available?The headband foam is on the thinner side and not very plush, and the earpad fabric isn\u2019t the softest.Not too shabby at all for a first entry in the open-back gaming headset game.Corsair Virtuoso Pro: Price & availabilityHow much does it cost?The speaker tags on the ear cups are replaceable and interchangeable \u2013 I\u2019m assuming here that Corsair will roll out a line of accessories at some point.It's also comfortable to wear for long hours, and very customizable.4.5 / 5PerformanceYou're getting bright, very detailed audio performance with a very wide soundstage and accurate imaging.And, for better or worse, that sound tends to bleed out, which means your office neighbors might hear heavy gunfire or whatever beats you\u2019re listening to if you don\u2019t keep that volume down.And, that\u2019s basically what you\u2019ll get with the Corsair Virtuoso Pro.Open backs are generally more spacious and wider in soundstage as the sound is going everywhere, instead of being stuck inside the ear cups.(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)Swipe to scroll

\u00a3169.99 / AU$239, it sits in the premium market, especially considering that it\u2019s wired.Listening to The Strokes\u2019 Reptilia hurt my ears and gave me a mild headache.Available nowWhere can you get it?Read our full Logitech Pro X 2 Lightspeed reviewHow I tested the Corsair Virtuoso ProSpent a week testing itUsed it for gaming, streaming, and music listeningTested it with a variety of games, songs, and moviesI tested the Corsair Virtuoso Pro for a week, using it as my main headset for gaming, media consumption, and work video calls.The earpads are plush, big, and made of breathable fabric, enveloping your ears while still keeping things airy \u2013 though that is also the nature of open-back headphones.Still, this new arrival is a big deal, as none of the big gaming peripheral manufacturers have been intrepid enough to explore it.Available in the US, UK, and AustraliaThe Corsair Virtuoso Pro is not a cheap purchase.And its sound imaging is just as impressive.Overall, you\u2019ll find the Corsair Virtuoso Pro a pretty impressive gaming headset \u2013 perhaps one of the best in the market right now.(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)Understandably, as it is its very first attempt at an open-back gaming headset, there are design choices that could have been better.Your voice will come through loud, clear, and audible here, which means that your teammates (or coworkers, if you choose to use this as your work headset as well) won\u2019t have trouble understanding you.Corsair Virtuoso Pro: Two-minute reviewIf you think about it, it makes a lot of sense to use a pair of open-back headphones when gaming as that tends to give the audio a bit more room to breathe, which should lend itself well to delivering that immersive soundstage and accurate sound imaging you want during gameplay.It has all the telltale signs \u2013 the elegant curves, the brand logo on the ear cups and yokes, and the luxurious but solid finish.I made sure to test its open-back quirks, AB'ing it with my favorite closed-back gaming headset, and put its features through their paces, making note of its build quality and comfort in the process.I\u2019ve been testing, reviewing, and using gaming headsets for years as a freelance tech journalist and now as one of the Computing editors at TechRadar.The ear cup yokes offer a lot of swivel, allowing the ear cups to conform to just about any head shape.Plus, the headset itself, while fairly lightweight, isn\u2019t the lightest out there at 338g, although that isn\u2019t surprising as wired open-back gaming headsets do tend to be on the heavier side.This headset delivers a lot of space, its soundstage even wider than the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro.To its credit, it is a very directional mic so that folks you\u2019re chatting with won\u2019t be able to hear any background noise \u2013 yes, that includes you tapping or button-mashing away at your keyboard.Those flaws are minor at best, however.They are a lot cheaper, and they\u2019re better-reviewed than what AT has on offer.Value: 4 / 5Corsair Virtuoso Pro: SpecsSwipe to scroll horizontallyInterface: 3.5mm wiredPlatforms: Windows PC, Mac, consoles,

the hassle of needing to charge every few days, this is one of the best wired gaming headsets out there.You got a collection going\nIf you're a gaming headset collector like me, this is a fantastic

gaming headset, which means that you will be tethered to your laptop or PC.But, you do get a nice set of cables in the box, a 3.5mm to dual 3.5mm audio cable with the mic boom, a 3.5mm to dual 3.5mm audio cable, and one y-adapter cable, which is necessary if you're connecting to your gaming PC.If you\u2019re not familiar with open-back headphones and gaming headsets, there are a few things to keep in mind.",

            "paraphrased_content": "This could have been a fluke, but I never got the same with the other phones.This allows Apple to coax serious developers and studios like Capcom and Ubisoft to bring console-level versions of their titles to the iPhone.File sizes are about half a megabyte larger than before, which will probably eat up your storage more quickly.Though the iPhone 15 Pro Max is smaller and lighter than the last generation, it\u2019s certainly still one of the heaviest in its category.Plus, the new titanium build makes the devices seem refreshed, while under-the-hood advances like the A17 Pro processor and a second-generation ultra wideband chip should make for smooth day-to-day use.Apple\u2019s portrait effect fared better when I changed over to 1x zoom, although as with older iPhones I have to move back a significant distance before the bokeh effects will kick in.Surprisingly, none of these tight squeezes caused the shortcut to trigger.But thanks to its new titanium build, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is fractions of an inch smaller and almost 20 grams (or about half an ounce) lighter than its predecessor.Its A17 Pro chip kept things running smoothly as I tested multiple camera and video modes in rapid succession, while downloading games, pulling up pictures and hotspotting to another iPhone nearby.Time with a new review unit is precious, and I couldn\u2019t risk wasting any of it on a dead phone.Not yet, anyway.If you\u2019ve been holding onto an iPhone that\u2019s at least two years old (or even just a year old), this could well be the year to upgrade.But when it did work, the iPhone\u2019s portrait mode produced a shallower, more pronounced depth of field than Google and Samsung\u2019s phones.I said this in my hands-on and I\u2019ll say it again: The iPhone 14 Pro Max felt like it would fracture my skull if it fell on my face, while the new model may only leave a bruise (or maybe a dent).For voice recordings, that becomes the start or stop key.In my sleep-deprived fog, I tried a few more times to jam the cable into the port.It\u2019s frankly been a blessing and a curse.The iPhone 15 Pro Max and Galaxy S23 Ultra fared respectably, though Samsung\u2019s phone was the most susceptible to overexposure from the lights.When I was getting ready in a hotel room, the background music I played sounded surprisingly clear and loud through its speakers.Thankfully, I have also not dropped either device so far, but, as in previous years, they\u2019re both rated IP68 for dust and water resistance, which should provide the clumsiest of us some peace of mind.At 10x zoom, the Galaxy S23 Ultra\u2019s pictures of the bird looked like I had captured images of the Predator, complete with extreme halo effect around the subject.On the other hand, it wasn\u2019t always easier to reach for the Action button, and though it\u2019s easy enough to identify it by size, I found myself accidentally pressing the volume keys a few times.I also appreciate the brushed metal finish on my Natural Titanium review unit, though I wish Apple would give the Pro line some brighter colors already.Apple didn\u2019t just crop in from a 48MP image to create these views \u2014 it created individual processing pipelines to enable these at the default 24MP resolution.It\u2019s also worth noting that, despite my concerns that the Action button might be too easy to accidentally trigger, I have yet to unintentionally launch the camera.It turns out that apparently most people set their devices to mute and leave it at that.I still get access to a physical key to quickly mute my phone, but for people who don\u2019t use that function, there are plenty more options.Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget\nWrap-up\nThis year\u2019s new iPhones actually feel like significant upgrades compared to the last two models.Don\u2019t expect high-end console level quality here, but you\u2019ll get pretty good animations in general.\u201cLet\u2019s charge the iPhone 15 Pro Max before going to bed,\u201d I thought wearily after a long day at Apple Park.It\u2019s worth pointing out that the iPhone\u2019s photos now use a default resolution of 24 megapixels, combining the light you get from 12MP shots and the detail from the 48MP sensor.It wasn\u2019t until about five attempts later that it hit me: This is USB-C.\nA spark of joy broke through the haze clouding my brain, until I realized I had to unplug my laptop or set up a whole new USB-C charger.Perhaps it will be a bigger improvement when people using older, Lightning-charging iPhones finally move on to USB-C and the whole world adopts this standard.In a very challenging situation when I was trying to shoot a gray heron that was bathing by Oyster Bay in Long Island, the iPhone was better at retaining the ripples on the water\u2019s surface, while the Pixel mostly overexposed the sea.Although Apple has worked on improving its Night mode, Google still has the upper hand in low light.Apple also managed to keep the same price for the Pro ($999) and Pro Max ($1,199) while doubling the storage capacity on the base model of the latter.But for most mobile photographers, that won\u2019t mean much.Meanwhile, the smaller Pro model is actually lighter than the S23 Plus (195 grams) and the Pixel 7 (197 grams, 6.9 ounces).They also charge via USB-C and come with the same new portrait image effects, which might be good enough for most people.Though the individual features seem small on their own, altogether this year\u2019s set of updates add up to more than the sum of their parts.The hole at the bottom is still a hole, while the button now juts out slightly more than before.Once you\u2019ve used the Action button to trigger your shortcut, you can keep pressing the button to control the primary action in each scenario.Practically, this just means you can tap the \u201c1\u201d icon at the bottom of the viewfinder to jump between 1x, 1.2x and 1.5x options.I did notice some hiccups when launching the camera with the Action button, but I suspect that has more to do with glitchy software than actual performance.What I didn\u2019t mention was that with the move to the new port, Apple was also able to add support for USB Power Delivery (USB PD), which allows the iPhone to charge up other devices.The Galaxy, on the other hand, is stuck at one zoom level.Yawn.For now, though, the change is small.I get the sense that this is a gesture I\u2019ll get used to over time, especially since it did eventually come in handy when I was frantically photographing some wild deer and rabbits in Caumsett State Historic Park.Gallery: iPhone 15 Pro Max camera samples | 22

in focus while retaining the frosty texture of the mounds underneath.It usually lasted about two days on a charge, which is slightly longer than other handsets of this size.I tend to leave my phone on my couch while doing chores, so every now and then I\u2019d set it to ring so I wouldn\u2019t miss calls from delivery people.One thing this processing allows Apple to do is offer three focal length options: 24 mm, 28mm and 35mm.Action button\nI was surprised to learn that I\u2019m actually in the minority of people who used the mute slider on older iPhones.On one hand, it\u2019s so much faster to use the Action button to open the camera than having to long press or swipe on the on-screen shortcut.Words were visible on distant objects, and blades of grass were clearer.I looked at the clock, glanced at the iPhone 15 Pro Max\u2019s battery indicator, shrugged and went to sleep.Meanwhile, the smaller Pro still retains a 3x optical zoom at 77mm.I know a lot of people slap a case on their new phones the second they get them, but some of us like to live a little dangerously and want a pretty color like those on the regular iPhone 15s.The newer phone rendered a window frame better, with a bit less noise than the iPhone 14 Pro Max.That\u2019s a pretty handy feature, especially considering how much battery life the iPhone 15 Pro Max has.Even though the device, which I had just unboxed a few hours earlier, was still showing at least 80 percent left of juice, I wanted to make sure it didn\u2019t run out the next day.Our review of that device is coming soon, so stay tuned if you can\u2019t decide between the standard iPhone 15 or the Pro.Of course, there\u2019s also the non-pro models of the iPhone 15 to consider, and thanks to their new 48MP sensors and pretty colors, they\u2019re a compelling, lower-cost alternative.In any case, Apple switching the mute slider out for the Action button doesn\u2019t bother me.Or you can change up the focal point altogether.I was able to check out a preview of Resident Evil Village on the iPhone 15 Pro and it ran smoothly as expected.But Google usually offers better contrast and shadows.It didn\u2019t work.Creepy babies aside, some of the graphics and lighting effects were nice and I saw no dropped frames, although the edges of a character\u2019s hair looked a little jagged.The Pixel delivered a more natural and subtle result, though.For the most part, the iPhone 15 Pro Max delivered solid landscapes and portraits in daylight, and has shown slight improvement at night.That\u2019s probably in part thanks to the fact that the new iPhone\u2019s edges are slightly curved, which not only makes them feel less sharp, but gives the handset the illusion of being thinner, even though it\u2019s actually a hundredth of an inch thicker than last year.I\u2019ve tossed the iPhone 15 Pro Max in a satchel full of other phones, a backpack stuffed with jackets and snacks, as well as a tightly packed overnight duffel bag.Meanwhile, if you\u2019ve always been a Pro user and already live in a USB-C world, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will almost certainly satisfy.It\u2019s no surprise, then, that in general, the Galaxy handset tended to deliver the clearest images at 3x, 5x and beyond.I used them both to take photos of an ad for the iPhone 15 Pro Max on the side of a building, and only after I zoomed all the way into the pictures on my laptop did I notice a slight difference.In the past, despite some performance benefits and superior features, Apple\u2019s largest handset has always felt too hefty.I also couldn\u2019t use this tool to fix the wonky ice cream photos, since multiple parts of the sprinkles remained blurry no matter where I tried to set a new focus.That\u2019s largely why Apple was able to retain the same screen sizes while bringing the length and width of each device down.But sadly, the iPhone still lags behind the likes of its Pixel and Galaxy competitors.My shots of trees and houses along a lake in the dark came out best on the Pixel, which retained the gradient in the sky and a bench in the foreground, without blowing out the lights from homes across the water.I haven\u2019t used the phones long enough, nor have I been brave enough to risk exposing these review units to my hazardous purse without a case, so I can\u2019t tell you how durable or scratch-resistant the titanium build is yet.Wording on the back of a faraway bus was so much clearer on the 15 Pro Max that I could actually guess what an ad said, while the 14 Pro Max\u2019s image was basically a blur.Of course, over time, I expect battery life to deteriorate and average out at about one and a half days, based on previous experience.If you\u2019re not looking for them, these differences aren\u2019t obvious.This works with the front camera and live photos well, and generally delivers pleasant results.For the latter two (specifically cats, dogs and people), Apple will automatically capture depth information so you can edit background blur later, and you won\u2019t have to go into Portrait mode just to get bokeh.Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget\nThere are, of course, two crucial external hardware changes this year: USB-C and the Action button.Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget\nTogether with the smaller bezels, the overall design changes make the iPhone 15 Pro Max slightly easier to use with one hand.Speaking of teeny measurements, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max\u2019s bezels are also ever so slightly smaller than before.I wanted to just be able to carry a single charger for the half dozen (or so) gadgets I carry around when I travel, but that\u2019s probably never going to happen.Performance, in use and battery life\nIt\u2019s hard to evaluate the performance of any new phone in just a week.It\u2019ll probably have enough power till I can plug it in in the morning.What might matter more on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are the new action button, camera improvements, refined design and updated processor.The good news is that with Apple\u2019s new Focus and Depth Control tool, you can go into most pictures and edit the amount of background blur.Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget\nDesign\nFor the first time, I\u2019ve found myself seriously considering switching to a Pro Max.Cameras \u2014 To zoom or not to zoom\nThis year, the Pro Max has a new telephoto lens that offers 5x optical zoom, thanks to a tetraprism design that reflects light four times within the iPhone\u2019s body and creates enough space for a 120mm focal length.Out of the box, handsets rarely have any lag, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max is as speedy as you\u2019d expect.I\u2019ve already described the impact USB-C actually makes in the real world, so I won\u2019t go on about it again.If I\u2019m going to have to bring multiple wires anyway, does it matter if one of them is Lightning?You can use a USB-C to Lightning cable to power up an AirPods case for example, or even another iPhone.As it turns out, although my dream of a one-charger-fits-all world had finally come true (at least for the devices I use), the utopia I had envisioned wasn\u2019t quite perfect in reality.Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 Pro Max\u2019s picture was a mess, with large parts of the spoon and ice cream blurred out and random other bits in focus.When it\u2019s time to recharge your iPhone, you can expect similar charging speeds to older models in that you should get up to 50 percent in about 30 minutes.And because the iPhone 15 Pros are slightly smaller than their predecessors, your old case will not fit.The Pixel 7 Pro is a bit lighter at 212 grams (7.5 ounces) while the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is the heaviest at 234 grams (8.25 ounces).With the introduction of the Action button, USB-C and some camera improvements, the changes coming to Apple\u2019s Pro handsets feel meatier than before.Ultimately, if you frequently use your phone to capture distant subjects, the iPhone 15 Pro Max will serve you well and has mostly caught up to the competition.Fast charge is supported with compatible power units, capped at 27 watts, which is basically the same as before.What might matter more in your daily photography scenarios is the updated portrait mode pipeline, which Apple says now \u201cbenefit from the Photonic Engine.\u201d I was really excited to see an improvement here, since I rely heavily on Portrait mode for most of my photos of food, animals and people.You can set it to open the camera, turn on the flashlight, begin a voice recording, change Focus modes or start a shortcut.In the camera, that\u2019s the shutter.Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S23 Ultra has 3x and 10x options, with a total of 100x zoom when combined with digital processing.The iPhone and Pixel both allow you to make use of these telephoto options while recording video, which came in handy when I tried to film a finicky baby deer from a distance.I dragged myself over to the work desk in my hotel room, unplugged my iPhone 14 Pro and stuck the Lightning charger into the iPhone 15 Pro Max.Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget\nIn the days that I\u2019ve been testing the iPhone 15 Pro Max, I\u2019ve set it to launch the camera, since I\u2019ve been focusing on testing the new hardware.Its video quality remains arguably the best in the industry, with cinematic mode videos still as aesthetically pleasing as before.The iPhone is surprisingly accurate at recognizing the outlines of subjects, although not all my pictures with people in them were identified as portraits.In the end, it does, but the convenience of being able to use any of the cables I have to charge any of the devices I own doesn\u2019t make as huge of a difference as I had expected.I loved looking at my new contact poster on the Pro Max\u2019s 6.7-inch display, and thanks to ProMotion\u2019s 120Hz refresh rate, scrolling through the long lists of my Instagram Story viewers was satisfyingly smooth.In each of those, you can fine-tune the settings to have the system, say, launch the camera in selfie or portrait mode.The iPhone 15 Pro Max\u2019s closest rival on the zoom photography front is Google\u2019s Pixel 7 Pro, which also offers 5x optical zoom.Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget\nOne of the biggest updates with the A17 Pro processor is the six-core graphics processor that enables hardware-accelerated ray-tracing for realistic lighting effects in games.When I set both cameras to shoot at the older phone\u2019s maximum range of 15x, the newer phone had a noticeable advantage.All it translates to are some nifty zoom options, which were fun to use but I didn\u2019t find myself reaching for them much.Compared to the Pixel 7 Pro, the iPhone 15 Pro Max offered similar clarity and detail, as well as brighter images.Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget\n\nIn reality, the iPhone 15 Pro Max delivered closeups that are slightly cleaner than what its predecessor was capable of.This year, you can choose from the silver-ish shade I have, or white, black and blue.",

            "paraphrased_content": "It\u2019s the familiar iPhone camera experience, now with a bit more flexibility in your composition options.No dongles.You get 256GB of storage for that price, which is what the 256GB 14 Pro Max cost last year; it\u2019s just that there isn\u2019t a 128GB option for the Pro Max anymore.The iPhone 15 Pro feels like one of those moments.The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max aren\u2019t breakthroughs, but a collection of small, important updates add up to real progress.A mute icon appears in control center now.This settings menu for the Action Button looks like no other Apple settings menu.The iPhone 15 Pro Max (left) makes more of an effort to hold onto the highlight detail in the boats on the horizon.So rather than referring to a full 48-megapixel frame for detail, it\u2019s able to put together a final 24-megapixel image with 1:1 detail from those center pixels.Again, no dongle or special accessory was involved in this process \u2014 just the same kind of hub you\u2019d plug right into your MacBook.A 5x lens will get you meaningfully closer to distant objects so you can play around with compression or frame a shot of that famous bridge without a lot of stuff in the foreground.You could shell out an extra $69 for Apple\u2019s Thunderbolt 4 data cable, but you shouldn\u2019t; 10Gbps USB-C cables are like $15 on Amazon.There\u2019s plenty of detail to play with if you\u2019d rather do your own cropping than let Apple\u2019s crop modes do the work, and it\u2019s nice to have access to all of those pixels outside of ProRaw.When I take pictures, I spend a lot of time jumping between portrait mode and the standard camera mode.The A17 Pro chipset is built different.There\u2019s the usual 15W wireless via MagSafe and 7.5W via Qi, too \u2014 possibly 15W over Qi2, but that\u2019s not a done deal.You can leave Live Photos enabled, too, and the depth info will be recorded right along with your moving image, so it\u2019s truly something you don\u2019t have to think about in order to use it.If you run your fingernail over the fabric the wrong way \u2014 which is very easy to do!The 15 Pro gets some useful new crop modes, even though it\u2019s stuck with the same old 3x telephoto.I know a lot of wide-angle-averse types who will switch right to 35mm when they get ahold of this phone, and I think they\u2019ll be happy with the results.The compressed high-res files are much smaller than the 48-megapixel ProRAW images: a HEIF file is around 4MB, and JPEGs hover around 9MB, while the ProRAW files can be upward of 70MB.This isn\u2019t exactly new \u2014 Apple\u2019s on its third generation gain map on the iPhone 15 \u2014 but the effect really seems to pop more than it did on the iPhone 14 Pro, at least to my eye.Apple is being uncharacteristically permissive and letting you use the port with a lot of your existing dongles, adapters, and hubs, and that\u2019s a wonderful thing.The 15 Pro and Pro Max get an important video update this year: the ability to shoot log.Beats the pants off both of them with its 10x lens.Most people should have no problem getting through a full day on a single charge, but the more concerning issue we\u2019ve seen on 14 Pro models is how quickly the maximum charging capacity seems to be degrading.They\u2019re not the product of simple digital zoom and up-rezzing, and there\u2019s a bit more that goes into them than just cropping the middle of the sensor.When Nilay moved to a different floor from that same Eero, speeds dropped to just 60\u201390Mbps until he flipped the 6E switch in settings to \u201coff.\u201d Once the phone connected to the 5GHz network, speeds jumped back up to a fairly normal 300Mbps.Death before digital zoom, etc.Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge\n\nThere was a time \u2014 a dark time \u2014 when it seemed like Apple would take all of the buttons away on the iPhone 15.Since you keep your phone silenced all the time anyway, why not have a button instead of a mute switch?I can see it at work very clearly when I\u2019m scrolling through thumbnail images in the Photos app and open one up, especially a photo with bright white highlights.Sadly, you just get mirroring.Since you apply color toning after capture, you can easily match it to the other cameras you use on a shoot \u2014 in our case, a big Canon camera that probably costs more than my first car did.According to Apple, photos from the native 24mm focal length and the 28mm settings follow the same process (or \u201cpipeline,\u201d as Apple likes to call it), going through the typical Deep Fusion process on a series of 12-megapixel frames and borrowing detail information from a full 48-megapixel frame captured immediately afterward.After a week with this camera system, I\u2019m really enjoying having them around.PreviousNext1/31iPhone 15 Pro main camera.PreviousNext1/31iPhone 15 Pro main camera.Apple wouldn\u2019t comment on any of this and just referred us to its battery support page, which says that a \u201cnormal battery is designed to retain up to 80 percent of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles when operating under normal conditions.\u201d And sure, it seems that most people who\u2019ve noticed the battery declining are above 80 percent.I set the Action Button on the 15 Pro Max to open the camera, which I thought I\u2019d really like.The 35mm setting has a slightly different process, owing to the fact that a 35mm crop happens to occupy the center 24 megapixels of the sensor.Side by side with the other Pro phone with a 5x zoom lens, Google\u2019s Pixel 7 Pro, the 15 Pro Max\u2019s telephoto keeps up well.It even acts as a shutter when you use the Action Button to open the camera, and I love a physical shutter button.That\u2019s worth celebrating, whether you\u2019re inside the walls of the garden or out.That\u2019s thanks partly to the new titanium alloy used on the phone\u2019s exterior in place of stainless steel.And I still think nothing is quite as good as old-fashioned optical zoom, but I\u2019m coming around to the idea of lossless crop zoom and these new 24mm and 35mm \u201clens\u201d options.It\u2019s more comfortable to use than the most recent Pro models, USB-C will very likely make life easier in the long run, there\u2019s a new button that will basically do whatever you want, and no matter your enthusiasm for photography, you\u2019ll probably enjoy at least one of the new camera features.But you don\u2019t have to go pixel-peeping to see that the iPhone produces a darker image overall.And it seems to work just as well as if you were in portrait mode from the start.It gets much toastier recording video or even tracking a DoorDash order in real time.Officially, they\u2019re natural titanium, white titanium, black titanium, and blue titanium.I have some other ideas for the Action Button, though, and the beauty is you can experiment with it until you find something you like.There\u2019s one more video feature coming to the iPhone that isn\u2019t available for testing now: spatial video recording.Even at a 5x zoom between its native lens focal lengths, it holds onto more detail than the iPhone does with its 5x camera.To use any of the iPhone 15 models, you have to agree to:The iOS terms and conditions, which you can have sent to you by emailApple\u2019s warranty agreement, which you can have sent to you by emailThese agreements are nonnegotiable, and you cannot use the phone at all if you don\u2019t agree to them.The iPhone also prompts you to set up Apple Cash and Apple Pay at setup, which further means you have to agree to:The Apple Cash agreement, which specifies that services are actually provided by Green Dot Bank and Apple Payments Inc. and further consists of the following agreements:The Apple Cash terms and conditionsThe electronic communications agreementThe Green Dot Bank privacy policyDirect payments terms and conditionsDirect payments privacy noticeApple Payments Inc. licenseIf you add a credit card to Apple Pay, you have to agree to:The terms from your credit card provider, which do not have an option to be emailedFinal tally: two mandatory agreements, six optional agreements for Apple Cash, and one optional agreement for Apple Pay.With all this processing power and a USB-C port, you\u2019d hope that Apple would let you run a full desktop environment when you plug the phone into an external display Samsung-style, right?The rest of the hardware is largely unchanged across the Pro and Pro Max: a 48-megapixel f/1.8 main camera, 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, and a 12-megapixel f/1.9 TrueDepth selfie camera around front.Astounding new camera hardware?Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nApple is making a big deal about its new SoC in the 15 Pro models: the A17 Pro.It\u2019ll do this whenever you tap on the frame to focus in a specific area, too, no human or pet needed.RelatedApple iPhone 15 and 15 Plus review: mainstream crossovers\n\nIt all amounts to a familiar phone with some much-appreciated modern conveniences.I\u2019m sure that will happen eventually, but until then, the iPhone 15 Pro actually gave us an extra button: the much-anticipated Action Button.In the future, you\u2019ll be able to use the 15 Pro to record 3D video that can be played back on a Vision Pro headset.Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nThe color options this year are muted as ever.You\u2019ll get faster file transfer speeds if you have a USB 10Gbps cable, which I don\u2019t because the one that comes in the box only supports USB 2 transfer speeds.When you open up the image in the Photos app, you\u2019ll see an option to turn portrait mode on.It\u2019s the best one, and I won\u2019t be taking any questions on that.That\u2019s incredible for a mobile device on Wi-Fi.Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nI\u2019m not sure that the days of breathtaking mobile tech advancements are ever coming back.Your friend with an Android phone will lend you their charging cable, and you\u2019ll think, \u201cOh, that was nice.\u201d\n\nAs for the other ways to connect your phone to the rest of the world, there are all the usual flavors of 5G \u2014 supposedly faster this year thanks to Qualcomm\u2019s new X70 modem but very hard to see in practice \u2014 and for the first time on an iPhone, Wi-Fi 6E.Digital lens FOMO no more.Breakthrough new features?The Pro models are mercifully lighter this year.The sides of both phones are very slightly curved compared to last year\u2019s models.I plugged a Satechi hub into the 15 Pro and watched it read photos from an SD card.Overall, Apple seems to be staying the course relative to Samsung and Google.The Pixel 7 Pro holds onto more color detail in dim light, though I see a bit more fine detail in greenery from the iPhone\u2019s image.Just a USB-C charger powering a USB-C iPhone.A custom neural network is used to piece it all together and produce a final 24-megapixel image.It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.All four iPhone 15 models have USB-C \u2014 hat tip to the EU regulators who made that happen \u2014 but only the 15 Pro and Pro Max are USB 3 compatible.Footage from the 5x lens is quite grainy in dim light, but outside of that, iPhone video clips remain some of the best in the game.Get out of here.Then I connected an ethernet cable and switched over to a wired internet connection just like that.It makes a noticeable difference.They retain enough of a flat edge that they still have that iPhone look, but they\u2019re a little more comfy in the hand.The Pixel 7 Pro does a little better in night mode where the 15 Pro and Galaxy S23 Ultra are a little more prone to the watercolor effect.Apple wants us to believe that nothing at all has been lost in this transition from a switch to a button, and I think that\u2019s mostly true.It doesn\u2019t have to be fancy \u2014 literally anything that holds your phone sideways while it charges will work.I know we all have a lot of mixed feelings about USB-C, but let me tell you about a beautiful thing that happened: the 15 Pro Max\u2019s battery was low, so I unplugged the USB-C charging cable from my MacBook Air and plugged it right into the phone.Display size remains the same: the 15 Pro still has a 6.1-inch screen, and the Pro Max goes big with the 6.7-inch display.But here\u2019s something: my husband\u2019s five-year-old iPhone XR is only down to 89 percent of its maximum capacity, according to its own self-reported battery stats \u2014 and so is one Verge staffer\u2019s iPhone 14 Pro.The 15 Pro starts at $999, like the 14 Pro did, but the 15 Pro Max\u2019s entry-level price is $100 higher this year at $1,199.Agree to continue: Apple iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro MaxEvery smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads.I can tell you for certain that a bunch of ProRes files will eat up your phone storage quickly\n\nBut the beauty of USB-C is that you can connect an external drive and record to an SSD.It\u2019s a 120mm equivalent with a combination AF and sensor-shift stabilizer.You\u2019ll see a little blue icon there when you plug in a USB accessory, which is nice.Android phone owners have been enjoying the flexibility of USB-C for years.But we\u2019re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate.The phone will still switch to a crop of the main camera in certain low-light conditions, but it stuck with the dedicated tele lens for some nighttime skyline shots.The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are no exception to recent trends: they\u2019re not seismic shifts; they\u2019re just a bit better than the things that came before them in a lot of small but meaningful ways.The camera uses a relatively small image sensor because that\u2019s how physics works, so unsurprisingly, the noise levels start creeping up rapidly even in moderate lighting.The 15 Pro Max, down from 240 grams to 221, actually feels like a regular phone and not an oversized paperweight.Just drop your question in the comments on this quickpost and I\u2019ll USB-C you soon.Even if you\u2019re reluctant about the change, I think there will come a day when USB-C makes your life a little easier.The flip side is that iOS 17 holds onto that 6GHz network a little too aggressively.Our editor-in-chief, Nilay Patel, has synchronous gigabit internet service and an Eero Wi-Fi 6E network at home, and the iPhone 15 Pro could consistently pull upload and download speeds of between 700 and 900Mbps when it was connected to 6GHz in the same room as one of the Eeros.Apple put some more work into its HDR processing for the 15 Pro, and a lot of the emphasis seems to be on capturing more highlight detail and saving that in the HEIF file\u2019s embedded gain map.It\u2019s also possible to think you\u2019re long-pressing the Action Button when you\u2019re actually holding the volume up key, and I can see the potential for a very embarrassing moment there.There are two distinct haptic signals to let you know whether the phone is set to ring or silent, so you can check without looking.And I\u2019ll just tell you right now to skip the FineWoven cases and accessories.It\u2019s only available in ProRes, and I can tell you for certain that a bunch of ProRes files will eat up your phone storage quickly.But it\u2019s a bit of a reach, and after the first week, I\u2019m not finding it any easier than swiping the homescreen to launch the camera and pressing the volume down button to snap shots.And they add up.Dex remains undefeated.If you have very fast home Wi-Fi, the 15 Pro can keep up.It\u2019s just one millimeter less on the height and width, but combined with the lighter weight and the curved edges, it\u2019s noticeably nicer to use than the 14 Pro.There\u2019s even a new icon in the control center to quickly mute and unmute sounds so you can customize away without losing that function.As someone who uses a lot of different phones throughout the year, I\u2019m not used to just picking up any old USB-C cable lying on my desk to charge an iPhone.The 15 Pro is ever so slightly smaller than the 14 Pro and noticeably lighter.There are very few surprises from new smartphones these days.I used to suffer a specific kind of FOMO when using anything but a native focal length on a phone camera.Flipping the mute switch was instantaneous.The 15 Pro is far from a breakthrough.But I do think some years will still see more measurable progress than others \u2014 the sum of a lot of small steps ahead rather than a single leap.Plenty of people are reporting that their battery life is down to 90 percent or lower in just one year of ownership, which is worrying.Apple\u2019s shipped a few Wi-Fi 6E devices already, but the iPhone 15 Pro is the first one that moves around as much as it does \u2014 an indicator showing which flavor of Wi-Fi was active would be helpful here, just like the various 5G indicators.We couldn\u2019t try it out yet, and we definitely don\u2019t have a Vision Pro to look at the footage anyway.No searching for another cable.The iPhone 15 Pro Max\u2019s 5x zoom lens at 100 percent crop (left) versus a tidier image from the Pixel 7 Pro\u2019s 5x zoom (right).The Pro Max can certainly handle an intense day of use with a fair amount of 4K ProRes video recording included, but it was right down into the single digits by the end of the day.Otherwise, it\u2019s handy, and I appreciate seeing how many minutes away my Uber is.As in the past, this is only something you\u2019ll see on a compatible HDR display (likely an iPhone but also some Macs and iPads) and only in certain applications (the Mac and iOS Photos app included, naturally) but Apple offers this API to third-party developers, so you might see it pop up more in the near future.Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nI think that sort of sums up how the switch to USB-C is going to go: either you\u2019ve wanted a USB-C iPhone for years because you hate having that one special cord for your phone, or you\u2019ve been living a peaceful existence with Lightning and you\u2019re irritated about having to swap out your cables or accessories.I\u2019ll be answering all your questions from 3-4PM ET today, Tuesday September 19th.This isn\u2019t just a vibe shift; these are updates you can see and measure.You can set 6E to \u201coff\u201d or \u201cautomatic\u201d in iOS settings; in automatic, the phone is meant to drop back to a 2.4 or 5GHz signal when the 6GHz signal gets weaker or slower.But know that it will be an option, and I imagine you will look way less goofy recording spatial video with your phone than on the headset itself.Realistically, they\u2019re all just different shades of neutral.A mute icon appears in control center now.This settings menu for the Action Button looks like no other Apple settings menu.The 5x zoom is fine, and it makes sense on the Pro Max.A lot of different forces outside of Cupertino helped shape the iPhone 15 Pro into what it is: competition and regulators included.This gives the feeling of a slight delay while you wait for your ringer to silence.The iPhone 15 series \u2014 regular and Pro alike \u2014 finds a clever way around this struggle by letting you apply the portrait mode effect after the fact.That would be awfully nice to toss in with a $1,200 phone!But this is the first time these features are all coming together on an iPhone, and it\u2019s an important moment if you\u2019re firmly rooted in the iOS ecosystem, as many people are.Maybe I\u2019ll give that \u201corder me a PSL\u201d button a shot.As usual, Apple took its time getting here \u2014 and it may have been dragged part of the way by the EU \u2014 but it\u2019s in a good place indeed.\u2014 you\u2019ll end up with a faint but seemingly quite permanent scratch.Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nIf there\u2019s one number I appreciated the most while using these phones over the last week, it was 19 \u2014 that\u2019s how many grams lighter the Pro and Pro Max are compared to their predecessors.It was a pleasant surprise to remember that yes, I can take a decent photo of the top of that skyscraper, even though I\u2019m using an iPhone.These are both valid positions, but having spent the past week with a USB-C iPhone, I\u2019ll tell you something from the other side: it\u2019s friggin\u2019 great.Oh, and the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra?Everyone has different usage and charging habits, sure, but there seems to be something else going on here, and Apple apparently isn\u2019t willing to answer for it right now.Since the Pro models have the always-on display introduced last year, StandBy\u2019s info at a glance is really useful.You can add a portrait effect after capture or put the focus somewhere else in the frame.Anytime the camera detects a face, cat, or dog in the frame, it automatically saves the depth information with your image file.Among the three, the iPhone doesn\u2019t win every category \u2014 special shoutout to the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\u2019s excellent portrait mode \u2014 but in a week of shooting with it in a lot of different conditions, the 15 Pro is the one most likely to deliver the color I was looking for consistently.But it can do a lot more than that: you can customize it to turn on your flashlight, open the camera app, or turn on a Focus mode, among other options.That\u2019s actually required if you want to film in 4K / 60p \u2014 you can shoot 4K / 24 and 4K / 30 right to the phone.Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nIn practice, this is somewhat hit or miss.If you\u2019re looking for a \u201cfun\u201d color, you\u2019ll want to go for blue.Something else you\u2019ll notice when you start using the main camera: 24 megapixels is the new default output resolution, up from 12 megapixels since\u2026 basically forever.You can cycle through them by tapping the 1x icon in the camera app, and you can set either of them as the default main camera focal length.You can also take a full 48-megapixel compressed image, either JPEG or HEIF, in addition to the 48-megapixel ProRAW enabled in last year\u2019s models.If there\u2019s any detail loss or noise penalty when using the 35mm in a dark bar rather than the standard 24mm, I can\u2019t see it.Apple doesn\u2019t make any claims of battery life improvements on the 15 Pro and Pro Max compared to last year\u2019s models.Having spent the past week with a USB-C iPhone, I\u2019ll tell you something from the other side: it\u2019s friggin\u2019 great\n\nLots of people will never plug anything but a charging cable into the port, and that\u2019s fine.In addition to the main camera\u2019s 24mm focal length, there are 28mm and 35mm options, too.It doesn\u2019t work automatically with night mode \u2014 you need to be in portrait mode from the jump to take a night portrait \u2014 but it does work with the telephoto lens and the selfie camera, which is handy.8Verge ScoreApple iPhone 15

basically just works with whatever USB-C cable or gadget you want to use it with.The iPhone 15 Pro isn\u2019t light by any means, but it feels that much more comfortable to use for a long period of time.Not all of them were included by choice, per se, but they\u2019re all welcome.Not Bionic, Pro.It takes the place of the 3x zoom, which is still on the 15 Pro.There\u2019s plenty of detail in this 48-megapixel JPEG: view the full image here.In this, the year 2023 of Big Phones!The iPhone\u2019s jump to a 24-megapixel image means there\u2019s more detail there for the taking straight from the default JPEG, but normalized to the same viewing size, I see about the same level of detail across the three cameras.Our new-old friend Dynamic Island is back this year on all iPhone 15 models, and it works just the same as it did on the 14 Pro.But the \u201caction\u201d on the Action Button happens when you long-press \u2014 not on a short press.Non-pros will appreciate the iPhone 15 Pro\u2019s video capabilities, too.Personally, I think this is a net positive since I rarely touch the mute switch, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite a one-to-one swap.I played through the first 20 minutes of Village, and the 15 Pro Max didn\u2019t get all that hot, surprisingly.That\u2019s the super flat color profile that videographers like because it lets them control the look of the final product more.You can also have it run a shortcut, which means it can do basically anything if you have the patience to program shortcuts.Per usual, Apple will not let you manually override this choice, so you\u2019ll need to use a third-party camera app if you want it to stick with the 5x zoom, no matter the conditions.The mute switch is gone, and by default, the Action Button does what it did: mute and unmute your phone\u2019s sounds.The Pixel 7 Pro image is just a little brighter and tidier, even if the level of detail looks about the same.And if you go to the trouble of picking up a new charging stand for the iPhone 15 Pro, I\u2019d suggest looking for one that will hold your phone horizontally so you can use iOS 17\u2019s StandBy mode.The 2x crop zoom option is back again this year, and when you have that at your disposal, a 3x lens feels a little redundant.It is generally unclear what Apple thinks \u201cPro\u201d means in this context except for \u201cgood at games,\u201d and indeed, the A17 Pro has an all-new GPU, which enables hardware-based ray tracing and makes photorealistic games like Resident Evil Village run more like they do on a console.As long as you don\u2019t expect too much, it will probably be a welcome update if you\u2019re coming from any phone that\u2019s not an iPhone 14 Pro.Despite its new charging port, the iPhone 15 series offers the same maximum charging speeds as the iPhone 14 \u2014 up to 27W with a wired charger.Per usual, the Samsung S23 Ultra (right) loves pushing those blue tones reflected in the building on the right.The 24-megapixel output plays an important role in the new crop lens options.Did we mention it\u2019s lighter?That\u2019s the stuff of early 2010 mobile technology.What\u2019s unusual this time around is how easy it is to boil those changes down to the simple numbers and specs: 19 grams, USB 3, 120mm.You\u2019ll also find phones with more zoom, better multitasking capabilities, and a smarter assistant on the other side of the walled garden.Got burning questions about the iPhone 15 Pro I didn\u2019t answer here?But it keeps your video producer happy, something I witnessed firsthand while we shot with the 15 Pro Max in ProRes log.Wi-Fi 6E runs at 6GHz, which is less congested than the familiar 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi bands we\u2019ve been using for years \u2014 it can be wicked fast, but the tradeoff is

the pressure.You can adjust the depth effect as before, but now, you can also put the focus on a different subject if you want.There are a couple of other \u201clenses\u201d available to the Pro

hardware, too: the 15 Pro Max\u2019s brand-new 5x telephoto lens.This gets tiresome and, if I\u2019m photographing my kid, can cause me to miss the shot I was going for while I was fumbling with settings.",
