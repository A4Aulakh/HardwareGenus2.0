            "paraphrased_content": "The custom slot is essentially a passthrough solution.Asus' connector-less graphics card concept could soon become a reality.As a result, the graphics card will not function on a typical motherboard.While we've already seen the GeForce RTX 4070 Megalodon and TUF Gaming Z790 BTF with a black theme, Eixa Studio saw a new white variant of the same GeForce RTX 40-series graphics card and an upcoming TX Gaming B760-BTF WiFi motherboard for Intel Raptor Lake and Raptor Lake Refresh processors.Due to the design and extra components required, the connector-less graphics cards and matching BTF motherboards will likely come with a slight premium compared to standard hardware.The million-dollar question is whether the higher price tag can convince consumers to jump on Asus' bandwagon.The cable-free design offers no performance benefits other than making your build look cleaner and avoiding the\u00a016-pin power connector\u00a0meltdown disaster.If the initiative takes off, the\u00a0best graphics cards\u00a0may not need power cables anymore.As opposed to the 16-pin power cable connecting to the graphics card, it connects to a slot on the back of the motherboard where the power passes through to the graphics card.It requires a proprietary expansion slot on upcoming Asus motherboards with the BTF (Back To Future) design, where the power connectors are behind the motherboard.Bilibili content creator\u00a0Eixa Studio, who recently attended Bilibili World 2023 exhibition in Shanghai, China, claims that Asus will start mass production of the connector-less graphics card in the Fall so that retail products may hit the market before the end of the year.Nonetheless, the graphics card doesn't magically draw power out of thin air, but a proprietary connection, which is one downside to Asus' design.Instead of PCIe power connectors, Asus implemented a custom connector called the \"GC_HPWR\" connector that takes after a PCIe x1 connector.The GC_HPWR connector resides beside the PCIe 4.0 x16 connector.The graphics card didn't have the conventional 8-pin PCIe connector or the novelty\u00a016-pin power connector, which has already gone through a\u00a0quick revision for improved safety.Demanding DIYers will surely love the idea since it'll help reduce cable clutter.One of the most impressive highlights at the Asus booth at Computex 2023 was a prototype\u00a0GeForce RTX 4070\u00a0without\u00a0external power connectors.",

which I definitely recommend using before attempting the game proper!There are two key things to remember.In the scenario above, CLAMP would be a great guess, as it could point the way to four of the seven words in one go.10.So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green.1.- and there are daily stats including a streak count.I'm a Quordle and Wordle fanatic who's been playing since December 2021, so I can definitely help you solve Quordle today and improve your game for tomorrow.If all goes well, that will give you a good lead on what one or sometimes two of the answers might be.You also get Quordle Achievements - specific badges for winning a game in a certain number of turns, playing lots of times, or guessing particularly hard words.It's played online via the Quordle website and you can also get to it via the Merriam-Webster site, after the dictionary purchased Quordle last year.9.In Wordle, you can instead try several of those in succession and hope one is right, assuming you have enough guesses left.Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green.* Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too).And rather than complete them in turn, you do so simultaneously.Send me an email and let me know.Daily Sequence today (game #548) -

Notice.Listeners may also see their favorite rewatch podcasts make some programming changes.\u201cThere are three ways to drive our revenue growth.Guests appearing on podcasts should not promote struck work under any circumstances,\u201d the union\u2019s national director of contract initiatives and podcasts, Sue-Anne Morrow, wrote in an email to Hot Pod.But don\u2019t expect out-of-work actors to launch any new podcasts \u2014\u00a0the union says both signing new contracts for rewatch podcasts and rewatch podcasts not under a SAG-AFTRA contract are off-limits.PRX will announce a full list of stations that will air the program later this year.According to the FAQ, the union is asking hosts of such podcasts to consider changing up their content during the strike\u2019s duration: \u201cYou are free to continue hosting your podcast that is signed to one of our agreements, but if you are able to pivot your show away from the promotion of struck work, we strongly encourage you to do so.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Spotify posted second quarter earnings this morning, showing that both premium users (220 million) and podcast ad revenue (30 percent increase) are up from last year.The union posted a new FAQ on how the strike impacts podcasts, with additional guidelines for rewatch and companion podcasts.It also announced plans to sublease its Manhattan offices at 4 World Trade Center by the end of the year.Interestingly enough, net charges of \u20ac44 million linked mostly to the shutting down of podcasts, severance for layoffs, and excess real estate put a slight dent in its gross profit margins this quarter.\u201cSo if you think about podcasting today, it\u2019s really high-quality content, but it requires quite a lot for you to get into new podcasting.We are all in this fight together.\u201d\n\nSpotify\u2019s gross profit margin dips in second quarter, but podcast ad revenue sees gains\n\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news for the Swedish audio giant.We can grow our users, we can create new business with new revenue streams, and we can increase revenue per user.Given the timing of when the contracts were signed, this guidance very likely gives the green light for new rewatch podcasts on Full House and Bones to launch their first episodes.The Ezra Klein Show will come to public radio stations in November as part of a new partnership between PRX and The New York Times.The Ezra Klein Show is a great example of a show that will do both,\u201d PRX\u2019s chief of business development and content, Jason Saldanha, said in a statement to Hot Pod.I also have an update on actor-hosted rewatch podcasts \u2014\u00a0and news of a new podcast coming to public radio.As first reported in NYT, the union still considers existing TV rewatch podcasts under a contract to be a form of promoting struck work \u2014\u00a0they can continue to publish new episodes during the strike.But company leaders told investors at today\u2019s earnings call that they\u2019re optimistic about the rest of the year due to an expected gain in users and revenue due to price increases.\u201cRewatch Podcasts are considered promotional.After a number of TV rewatch podcasts halted their programming due to confusion over whether they break the Hollywood strike\u2019s rules, the SAG-AFTRA union clarified its rules to Hot Pod.But a net loss of \u20ac302 million this quarter suggests it will be some time until we see a positive effect from the company\u2019s efforts to streamline operations.Hosts should honor any pre-existing contracts but, if a contract is not involved, they should not promote struck work, past or current.Despite layoffs and the shutdown of a number of podcasts, it\u2019ll be a while until we see the benefits from a thriftier company.But he also added that growing the number of ad-supported and Premium users was the platform\u2019s preferred route for revenue growth.Today, I\u2019ll dive into Spotify\u2019s second quarter earnings call this morning.\u201cMembers should not accept any new contract to host a show that promotes struck work while the union is on strike,\u201d says the FAQ.Spotify is in the early stages of its experiments with AI, and the company is looking at bringing more AI features to the platform.The popular podcast hosted by the founder of Vox is only the latest to make the transition to public airwaves.This is\u00a0Hot Pod,\u00a0The Verge\u2019s newsletter about podcasting and the audio industry.The company recently announced a $1 hike in the price of its Premium subscription in the US and has increased subscription prices in more than 50 markets worldwide.In its quest to reduce losses, the company this year took some drastic steps: it laid off around 800 workers (including 200 employees from its podcast operations), merged the Gimlet and Parcast podcast studios, and made several high-profile programming cuts \u2014 including not renewing its deal with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s production company, Archewell Audio.It instructs members who are approached by a producer to appear in a companion, rewatch, or other entertainment-focused podcast to steer clear of such work.So one very easy thing we can do with these new AI developments is of course summarize what these podcasts are about, and by doing so, you can imagine it becoming a lot easier to merchandise new podcasts for consumers, which drives in higher engagement and more growth for creators \u2014 which is a really positive thing,\u201d Vogel said.Hot Pod / News and analysis on the biggest events in audio.But the union is giving a lot less leeway to any future projects.Sign up\u00a0here\u00a0for more.The podcast version of the one-hour weekly show will still be distributed by the Times, but PRX will serve as the distributor of the public radio program, according to a press release viewed by Hot Pod.Margins are 24.1 percent this quarter, compared to 25.2 percent last quarter (and 24.6 percent YoY).Our preference among them is to focus on growing the overall number of consumers on our platform, as this gives us scale advantages and retains optionality for the future.Chief financial officer Paul Vogel bought up AI in podcast discovery as an example.\u201cOur goal is to bring stations in the U.S. programming that delivers listeners clarity on the world around them and enrichment to their lives.The Ezra Klein Show is coming to public radio\n\nAnother podcast is coming to public radio.However, we\u2019ve also been clear that there will come a time when price increases become a more important tool in the toolbox,\u201d Ek said.(Disclosure: The Verge and Vox are both part of Vox Media.)And average revenue per user dipped as well, to \u20ac4.27 (around $4.72), a 6 percent decline from last year and a decrease from last quarter\u2019s \u20ac4.32 (around

(368.5g) and the left speaker weighs 12.36 ounces (350.4g).The soundstage is a bit larger than it is with most 2.0 systems, though it\u2019s still just a stereo setup and not surround (and the BMR1s don\u2019t come with software or even offer a digital connection, so there\u2019s no built-in virtual surround).And while the BMR1s do sound very good, especially for their size, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d call their sound \u201caudiophile-level.\u201d\u00a0Music sounds quite good on the BMR1s, so long as you\u2019re looking for a very neutral sound profile.So it\u2019s not too surprising that Drop has decided to take its audio line to the next level with a surprisingly slim pair of desktop PC speakers: the BMR1 Nearfield Monitors.And, of course, the proprietary speaker cable input on both the right and left speakers.But this is all relative: they\u2019re absolutely better than your laptop\u2019s built-in speakers or \u2014 (god forbid) \u2014 the speakers on your desktop monitor.(It mentioned \u201caudiophile products,\u201d \u201caudiophiles,\u201d \u201chigh-quality desktop speakers,\u201d and sounding \u201cgreat\u201d \u2014 but stopped short of calling these audiophile-level speakers.)Two additional runs of 1,000 units also sold out, and the speakers are currently on their sixth run of 1,000 units (still available as of this writing).They\u2019re not the best speakers you\u2019ll ever hear, nor are they my personal favorite listening speakers.I really wanted to like these and I do like them, especially for how easy they are to fit into a desktop setup (I may or may not have a hate-hate relationship with trying to fit speakers into my desktop setup), but at the moment the BMR1s just feel like they\u2019re not quite there.If you\u2019re used to listening to music with bass-heavy headphones/headsets, the BMR1s are definitely not... that.For audio input, the right speaker has a 3.5mm stereo aux-in, as well as wireless input (Bluetooth 5.0).Speaking of volume \u2014 while the BMR1s are fairly loud for how little space they take up, they\u2019re not particularly loud for PC speakers.And from the left monitor when nothing is happening but the speakers are in analog or headphone mode.also sound very good on the BMR1s, though I did notice some slight graininess in the lower midrange when the speakers were turned up fairly loud.Drop says the drivers are tuned to deliver a \u201cholographic, natural frequency response\u201d that\u2019s perfect for \u201cmovies, music, and more.\u201d(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)BMR drivers also offer wider dispersion than their conical counterparts \u2014 they feature more off-axis output and less directional sound, which makes them better for multiple listeners.While a lot of articles covering Drop\u2019s announcement of the BMR1 Nearfield Monitors suggested Drop claimed they would have \u201caudiophile-level sound,\u201d I think it\u2019s important to note that Drop pretty carefully tip-toed around making that statement in its press release.This is maybe partly because it\u2019s powered on all the time, because there\u2019s no power button (just a multi-function button with several functions that are not power).If anything, they\u2019re a little too neutral for me, as I prefer my neutral profiles to lean a little warm.Drop sells optional, interchangeable magnetic speaker grilles separately in several colors \u2014 black, white, raw steel, \u201claser purple\u201d (deep purple/navy), \u201cshinai sage\u201d (sage green), and \u201cskiiboard orange\u201d (orange).Pressing the button once switches to Bluetooth mode (press and hold in Bluetooth mode to enter pairing mode), pressing it again enters headphone mode (if headphones are connected).If you mount the speakers vertically, each speaker will measure approximately 11.3 inches (288mm) tall by 2.6 inches (66mm) wide by 3.94 inches (100mm) deep.Newly-minted Corsair subsidiary Drop is best known for its keyboards

hardware (screws, washers, and a hex key), a power block/cord, a 4-foot (1.2m) speaker interconnect cable, and a 3.5-foot (1m) AUX cable.If you mount the speakers horizontally, each speaker will measure approximately 3.46 inches (88mm) tall by 10.63 inches (270mm) wide by 3.94 inches (100mm) deep.Default mode (analog-in) is denoted by a white LED, Bluetooth by a blue LED, and headphone mode by an orange LED.31, 2023Performance of the BMR1 Nearfield MonitorsThe BMR1 Nearfield Monitors are so slim because they use Balanced Mode Radiator (BMR) drivers (manufactured by Tectonic Audio Labs), instead of traditional cone-shaped pistonic drivers.The midrange, by comparison, sounded a little compressed, which caused midrange-heavy songs like K-391\u2019s Lonely World and Pepas\u2019 Farruko to sound less dynamic.They also feature interchangeable magnetic speaker grilles, which are sold separately in several colors (with more colors/designs in the future tentatively promised).I will note that this is not a power button \u2014 there\u2019s no power button on these speakers, nor is there volume control.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Aside from their dual-mounting capabilities, the stands that come with the BMR1s are pretty basic: they\u2019re made of matte black plastic and have anti-slip rubber corners on the bottom and Drop\u2019s logo engraved at the base, and they\u2019re not adjustable.They\u2019re not only very slim and very lightweight compared to most of the competition,they\u2019re also designed in such a way that I can see them fitting into even the most cluttered desk setup.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The right speaker houses all of the ports, including the power input.The speaker interconnect cable appears to be proprietary \u2014 while most people will not be putting their speakers more than 4 feet apart, such a short cable doesn\u2019t allow for a lot of flexibility when it comes to cable management (the AUX cable is also laughably short, but at least that can be easily swapped out).Movies, TV shows, podcasts, talk radio, etc.They feature both analog and Bluetooth connectivity and have an aux-out port that lets you plug in an optional subwoofer.And while they\u2019re not as objectively loud as some of the other speakers on our list of best PC speakers, the BMR drivers\u2019 wide dispersion means they can fill a medium-sized room better than you might expect.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The BMR1s have a frequency response of 80 Hz - 24,000 Hz.The company plans to offer additional colors/designs in the future.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)I don\u2019t dislike the \u201cspare, industrial style\u201d of the speakers sans grilles, and exposed drivers are certainly not uncommon in the speaker world.I was also impressed with the BMR1s\u2019 gaming performance \u2014 they\u2019re not particularly tuned for gaming like some PC speakers are, but the detailed high range and \u201cholographic soundstage\u201d Drop keeps mentioning make these speakers surprisingly good for both competitive FPS/Battle Royale type games and immersive, aurally-rich RPGs.They can be mounted either vertically or horizontally, depending on your setup \u2014 if you mount them horizontally, they\u2019ll fit pretty neatly under most desktop monitors.They sound good, especially for their size, with an almost too-neutral sound profile and a larger-than-average soundstage.Personally, I\u2019d grab something cheaper, like the Creative Pebble Pros, and wait until the BMR2s drop.Each speaker measures approximately 10.63 inches (270mm) long by 2.55 inches (64.8mm) wide, and is just 1.62 inches (41.2mm) deep.But I do think the BMR1s look sort of unfinished without grilles (especially as you can see the glue around the drivers).The stands have a groove to help guide and stabilize the speakers once they\u2019re attached, but it\u2019s not the most stable setup I\u2019ve seen \u2014 the speakers were a little wobbly when mounted (both ways).If you think these sound pretty awesome, you\u2019re not alone \u2014 Drop announced the BMR1s in January with three initial runs, all of which sold out immediately.The BMR1s have a fairly wide and detailed high range, producing clear but not overly bright treble in songs such as Britney Spears\u2019 Toxic and Pitbull\u2019s International Love.It does seem like Drop could have included something in the $129 base price.The BMR1s\u2019 SNR is good (> 95 dB), but there\u2019s a lot of noise \u2014 buzzing, popping, distortion \u2014 when you fiddle with either side of the analog connection.But gamers will want to plug into the speakers directly, because there\u2019s a very noticeable lag over the BMR1s\u2019 Bluetooth connection.Bottom LineThe Drop BMR1 Nearfield Monitors are interesting.The speakers are fine in terms of build quality, but the standard-issue black plastic chassis looks and feels a bit cheap for how much these cost.But where the BMR1s do shine is in their lack of distortion \u2014 these speakers sound almost as good when they\u2019re at or near maximum volume as they do at 50%.In our volume test, the BMR1s delivered 73.1 dBA at 50% volume and 85.3 dBA at max volume, which is similar to the Audioengine A2+\u2019s maximum volume level.(Maybe a little too bright \u2014 it would be nice if this could be dimmed or turned off.)There\u2019s also a mode switch for switching between 2.0 (without subwoofer) and 2.1 (with subwoofer).The main benefit of BMR drivers is their size \u2014 each of the BMR1s features a flat, square, two-inch BMR driver and dual force-canceling passive radiators.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Each stand\u2019s footprint measures 2.6 inches (66mm) wide by 3.94 inches (100mm) deep.That\u2019s not great on the low end, though the dual force-canceling passive radiators do a decent job of producing deep, meaningful bass \u2014 and the BMR1s do give you the option of plugging in an external subwoofer if you\u2019re really looking for powerful lows.(Of course, the A2+\u2019s are quite a bit larger, measuring 6.25 x 4.2 x 5.6 inches (158.75 x 106.68 x 142.24mm) each and weighing 6.8lbs (3.08kg) together.)The right speaker (the active speaker) gets a little worryingly warm near the bottom when it\u2019s plugged in.The speaker also has a headphone jack (with mic passthrough) and an aux out or subwoofer out for plugging in an optional subwoofer.The speakers come with plastic \u201cisolation stands\u201d that allow for either vertical or horizontal placement.(This also means you can be more flexible with placement/positioning \u2014 the BMR1s will sound largely the same whether they\u2019re mounted vertically or horizontally.The company also sells its own merchandise, which includes keyboard kits, pre-built keyboards, and headsets (as well as... other things, occasionally).(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)There\u2019s a small multi-function button on the front of the right speaker, which is ringed in a bright LED when the speakers are plugged in.I also have a few design petpeeves \u2014 such as the proprietary and short speaker cable, as well as the bright LED ring around the non-power button, the fact that the headphone jack is on the back of the right monitor and not easily accessible.And when your PC goes to sleep, wakes from sleep, or powers on/off.The BMR1s alone cost $129 and do not come with speaker grilles; grilles can be purchased separately for $25 - $39 (depending on color).Design of the BMR1 Nearfield MonitorsImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Design is a big part of the BMR1s\u2019 appeal: these slim, sleek rectangles have a tiny footprint compared to most PC speakers.The grilles cost $25/pair (except for \u201craw steel,\u201d which costs $39), and are made of coated steel mesh in a plastic frame.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge\n\nResearch firm IDC blames \u201cmacroeconomic headwinds, weak demand from both the consumer and commercial sectors, and a shift in IT budgets\u201d for six consecutive quarters of contraction in the PC market.Microsoft had been hoping to have finalized its Activision Blizzard acquisition by the end of its Q4 fiscal 2023, but the deal deadline has been extended until October 18th.Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge\n\nMicrosoft said Xbox Game Pass had\u00a0grown to 25 million subscribers\u00a0in January 2022, but we haven\u2019t had an update for more than 18 months now.As expected, Windows and devices revenue has been hit hard again this quarter, but Xbox has rebounded somewhat \u2014 at least on the content side.Microsoft CFO Amy Hood offered up some guidance for what to expect from the company\u2019s Q1 2024 fiscal gaming performance.A slide disclosed in the FTC v. Microsoft hearing revealed that Azure contributed around $34 billion in revenue for Microsoft\u2019s 2022 fiscal year, and it\u2019s likely that this disclosure prompted Microsoft to give a somewhat vague update on Azure revenue.Image: Microsoft\n\nInvestors have been hoping to get an idea of Microsoft\u2019s potential AI revenues, particularly after the company unveiled its steep Microsoft 365 Copilot pricing last week.A new Xbox Game Pass Core subscription will be available in September priced at $9.99 per month to replace Xbox Live Gold.Microsoft has been making a bigger effort with PC Game Pass growth instead, with PC Game Pass launching in 40 new markets earlier this year.Microsoft and Activision agreed to extend the deadline to allow both companies to negotiate with UK regulators on a change to the transaction that will allow the deal to close.A big part of that was down to Azure and other cloud services revenue growing by 26 percent this quarter, driven by what Microsoft describes as strong demand for its consumption-based services.Microsoft launched a new\u00a0$1.99 a month Microsoft 365 Basic subscription\u00a0earlier this year, which is clearly having some impact on numbers.There\u2019s no sign if it will return at a later date.Nadella did reveal that Microsoft set fourth quarter highs for Xbox monthly active users and record fourth quarter engagement across Xbox Game Pass, but without numbers this doesn\u2019t really tell us much.Image: Microsoft\n\nAs always, Microsoft\u2019s cloud businesses are really driving the company\u2019s revenue.Devices at Microsoft includes HoloLens, PC accessories, and Surface devices.The EU went on to approve the deal with a key cloud gaming remedy in place.Xbox Game Pass Ultimate has moved from $14.99 per month to $16.99 (\u20ac14.99 / \u00a312.99).Surprisingly, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed on today\u2019s earnings call that Microsoft Cloud sales passed $110 billion in the 2023 fiscal year, with Azure making up more than 50 percent of this revenue for the first time.A number of Microsoft\u2019s AI efforts are currently in preview, so the company hasn\u2019t started disclosing revenue from those yet, as they\u2019re limited to a small number of organizations.Microsoft\u2019s cloud, office, and server businesses continue to make up for a weaker PC market.Windows OEM revenue, the price that PC manufacturers pay Microsoft to put Windows on laptops and PCs, has dropped significantly for the entire fiscal year, or four quarters in a row.Microsoft\u2019s entire fiscal 2023 hasn\u2019t been great for its Windows and devices revenue compared to fiscal 2022.Microsoft had expected low- to mid-teens for Xbox content and services revenue, so just 5 percent is a miss here.Revenue is up 8 percent, and net income has increased by 20 percent.\u201cWe continue to work through the regulatory approval process and remain confident about getting the deal done,\u201d said Nadella during Microsoft\u2019s earnings call.Microsoft also recently adjusted its Xbox Game Pass pricing.Overall devices revenue has dropped by 20 percent in Q4, and Microsoft CFO Amy Hood warned on an earnings call today that next quarter will be worse.Office commercial products and cloud services revenue also grew by 12 percent year over year thanks to Office 365 Commercial revenue growth of 15 percent.Microsoft also makes Xbox devices, which are separated from its other hardware.Microsoft is expecting its Q1 2024 fiscal devices revenue will likely decline in the \u201cmid 30s,\u201d thanks to the overall PC market and \u201cadjustments we made in our portfolio with an increased focus on our higher margin premium products.\u201d Microsoft revealed earlier this year that its mice, keyboards, and webcams are being discontinued in favor of premium Surface accessories.Microsoft\u00a0just posted\u00a0the fourth and final quarter of its 2023 fiscal financial results.Xbox Series S and X.Xbox content and services should be up in the \u201cmid to high single digits,\u201d with overall gaming revenue expected to be up \u201cmid single digits.\u201d Hood didn\u2019t offer up any guidance on Xbox hardware revenues in Q1 2024 fiscal, though.Microsoft\u2019s intelligent cloud business saw revenue of $24 billion this quarter, up 15 percent.Overall gaming revenue is also up just 1 percent.Microsoft has not changed its PC Game Pass pricing, though.Xbox hardware revenue has dropped 13 percent in Q4, so it\u2019s likely that Microsoft continues to suffer with hardware supplies and softer demand for its Xbox Series S / X consoles.Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers have grown to 67 million, up from the 65.4 million reported in the previous quarter.The UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked the deal over cloud concerns in April, just a day after Microsoft\u2019s Q3 2023 earnings report.The plan had spread to eight countries, but Microsoft acknowledged\u00a0this was a \u201cpreview program\u201d all along and will cease to exist on August 15th.Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer did reveal in October that Xbox Game Pass growth had\u00a0stalled on the console side\u00a0of the service, though.We should get a much better understanding of Microsoft\u2019s AI revenue potentials once Microsoft 365 Copilot is available later this year and if Microsoft starts to discuss Azure OpenAI revenue.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella didn\u2019t offer any update on Xbox Game Pass subscriber numbers during an earnings call with investors today, either.In Q4, that means Windows OEM revenue fell by 12 percent, which Microsoft says was \u201cprimarily driven by the PC market.\u201d\n\nThe Surface Laptop 5.Microsoft CFO Amy Hood blamed the miss on \u201cweakness in first-party and third-party content performance,\u201d in an earnings call today.The software maker made $56.2 billion in revenue and a net income of $20.1 billion during Q4.Update, July 25th 6:10PM ET: Article updated with comments from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft CFO Amy Hood.The base Xbox Game Pass for Console pricing has also been increased from $9.99 a month to $10.99 (\u20ac10.99 / \u00a38.99).\u201cWe\u2019re still early in our journey,\u201d says James Ambrose, director of investor relations at Microsoft, in a call with The Verge.Microsoft also announced plans to\u00a0end its Xbox Game Pass Friends & Family plan\u00a0in August.But it\u2019s still early days, and it\u2019s difficult to say how much AI has impacted Microsoft\u2019s revenues this quarter.It features multiplayer online gaming and a new small catalog of more than 25 games \u2014 including\u00a0Gears 5,\u00a0Forza Horizon 4, and\u00a0Psychonauts 2.Or it could be related to Microsoft\u2019s long-term strategy and balancing the costs of hardware against content and cloud potential.Nadella also revealed that Azure OpenAI now has more than 11,000 customers and that more than 27,000 organizations are using GitHub Copilot.Lower shipments of laptops and PCs have also hit Microsoft\u2019s devices revenues again.Xbox content and services revenue, which includes Xbox Game Pass, is up 5 percent, though.Investors are keen to know more about Microsoft\u2019s AI revenues.This suggests that Xbox Game Pass has grown year over year, despite Microsoft still not providing updated subscriber numbers.",

            "paraphrased_content": "If you're looking for some console war ammunition, there's not much difference between the PS5 and XSX versions of the game.Oddly, Performance mode isn\u2019t much better and it also adds a ton of screen-tearing to the mix.There\u2019s no doubt Remnant II often looks nice \u2013 Digital Foundry highlights the game\u2019s impressively-detailed objects and the use of Epic\u2019s Nanite tech to eliminate pop-in.Sure, we\u2019ve seen demos like The Matrix Awakens running on UE5, and Fortnite now uses the engine, but a fully developed game that tries to use UE5 to push the visual bar?Much like the recently-released Final Fantasy XVI, it seems Remnant II\u2019s Quality Mode is actually your best bet for performance \u2013 sure, it\u2019s only 30fps, but it\u2019s a consistent 30fps, only dropping a frame or two here and there.Remnant II is far from perfect on PC, turning in so-so performance even with top-of-the-line graphics cards, and developer Gunfire Games has admitted the game was designed around upscaling tech like DLSS and FSR.Share this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n TwitterBut what about consoles?That said, Epic has tried to sell us the fantasy of cutting-edge visuals without a large jump in hardware requirements, and it seems that might have been overblown.Remnant II has attracted a lot of attention for being one of the first major games on the market to be developed using Unreal Engine 5, Epic\u2019s much-heralded new engine that will be at the core of a lot of future titles.The only difference is that setting your console to 120hz mode will allow for uncapped framerates on XSX in Performance Mode, while PS5 remains locked to 60s.On both PS5 and Xbox Series X, Remnant offers three visual options including a 30fps Quality mode, and 60fps Balanced and Performance modes.Well, the results are a little iffy there too.Of course, this is just one game and not necessarily representative of how all Unreal Engine 5 games will perform.Despite those low native resolutions, Balanced and Performance mode do not hold up all that well.A cost even current-gen consoles and cutting-edge graphics cards may struggle to pay.Balanced mode sometimes maintains its 60fps target, but can drop all the way down to the mid-30s.If you\u2019ve got around 15-minutes to spare, you can check out their full video, or scroll on down for our recap of the most relevant points.But it seems it comes at a cost.Remnant II is available now on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.The folks at Digital Foundry have taken Remnant II for a spin on both the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, and while they found the level of visual fidelity was solid, performance leaves something to be desired.All three modes upscale to 1440p, with rather low native resolutions \u2013 Quality is around 1296p, Balanced is 792p on average, and Performance is a mere 720p.Those are still rare.Meanwhile, the Xbox Series S only offers one mode, running at around 900p and 30fps, with drops into the mid-20 range.That said, uncapped framerate also means even bigger performance swings, so it isn't necessarily a big point in Xbox's favor.Expect a Wccftech review soon.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Despite injecting some much-needed excitement into the mobile space, even the best foldables have failed to draw peoples\u2019 attention the way the likes of Apple\u2019s iPhones have.. Four years on from the original Galaxy Fold, we\u2019re questioning whether the form factor will ever go mainstream, or if interest will solely remain with the power-users\u2019 and tech fanatics\u2019 who already believe in a foldable future.They are growing rather fast, that is true, but so did Chromebooks and Windows Phones.One might have a hole punch front-facing camera, another a notch, a rounded frame or a straight-sided frame is about as diverse as it gets.With Samsung Unpacked 2023 now only hours away, tech enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating the unveiling of the latest offerings from the renowned tech giant \u2013 the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5.Either we'll all be tapping away on our foldables \u2013 the question answered \u2013 or we'll find ourselves observing friends geeking out about their foldables with a sense of detachment and a prepared, \"that's nice dear\" as we press on with our candy bar-style Galaxy S27s, Pixel 12s and iPhone 19s.In four years, Samsung might be preparing to launch the Galaxy Z Fold 9 and Flip 9, and by then, the question of foldables' popularity will likely be settled.Foldables have not set the market on fire.Clamshell foldables, for instance, evoke nostalgia \u2013 with a design reminiscent of the original Razr; bringing back a sense of intentionality (tapping a button on-screen to end a call is nothing compared to the satisfaction of being able to physically close your phone).However, since overall consumer response to foldable phones is improving and Apple will be possibly releasing non-phone foldable products soon, the brand\u2019s participation in the foldable smartphone market is likely to occur after 2025,\u201d Counterpoint senior analyst Jene Park said.It\u2019s easy to grow rapidly from zero.Drawing parallels to the convertible laptop market, where the initial wave of enthusiasm eventually subsided and the best laptops predominantly remain clamshells, foldables might not become ubiquitous.The future?These now-conventional foldables have reached the stage where there\u2019s no longer a place for devices like the LG V50 ThinQ (with its Dual Screen accessory) \u00a0or the Microsoft Surface Duo 2; they\u2019re now the status quo (at least where folding mobile devices are concerned).A bridge to nowhere?The Galaxy Z Flip 4 is an excellent foldable, soon to be surpassed.Round the back, a camera bump sits, often to the top right or \u2013\u00a0if the design team is feeling adventurous \u2013 the middle.This is where foldable and clamshell devices step in, breaking away from the traditional candy bar shape and offering distinctive form factors that serve unique purposes.Comparing the best iPhones to the best Android phones reveals only minor differences in features like display design and camera placement.(Image credit: Future / Alex Walker-Todd)As such, despite the flames of excitement surrounding foldable phones that still burn amongs enthusiasts, it's essential to approach their potential widespread acceptance with a dose of realism.Meanwhile, foldable with a hinge which runs top to bottom offer the versatility of both a smartphone and a tablet; allowing users to switch between form factors as needed.At the same time, just by releasing the Galaxy Fold 5 and Flip 5, Samsung continues to solidify these form factors in the market; moving the dial from \u2018new and extraordinary\u2019 towards just \u2018ordinary\u2019.While leaks and rumors have given us a glimpse into what these phones are likely to offer, there\u2019s \u00a0a lot more at stake than just two new devices.The introduction of foldable and clamshell smartphones by the world's second-largest smartphone brand adds an intriguing twist to a market that some may argue has become somewhat predictable and mundane.Apps like TikTok, Halide, and the integration of generative AI into Android with Android 14 have certainly brought fresh experiences to users, however, the evolution of physical smartphone designhas been comparatively glacial.Microsoft's Surface Pro line remains a prominent outlier, but other companies like Google, Samsung, and Acer have shifted their focus back to traditional laptops and tablets, and there\u2019s a chance phone makers could do the same.Apple has not hinted at joining the foldable fiesta anymore than it dove into the laptop convertible carnival; something that\u2019s sure to have an effect on the product category one way or another.Predictions that Apple may still jump into the foldable space seemingly rely on the form factor holding consumers\u2019 attention for at least the next year or so.\u201cApple is still absent from our short-term forecasts.(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)For years, smartphone hardware has largely felt stagnant, with software innovations driving much of the excitement.Or a fun diversion... (Image credit: Future / Philip Berne)The future being what it is, we can only truly speculate about the forthcoming of foldable devices.Spicing up a predictable market?The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 and the Honor Magic Vs are just two of the many book-style foldables on the market.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Sure, it's a bit chunky, you shouldn\u2019t leave it out on the porch in the rain and you\u2019ll need to keep track of the specific charging cable, but that\u2019s doable.Some types of modern digital music didn't come across quite as well here, so it's worth testing your types of tunes before buying.The bass and treble start out flat in the 12-o\u2019clock position, letting you boost or lower those levels as desired.Plus, since there\u2019s no USB charging, you'll want to keep track of the power cable that came with the device.This got me to the 10-percent warning and seems par for the course in regards to battery life.Photo by Jon Turi / Engadget\nWrap-up\nWhile I wouldn\u2019t quite call it an audiophile speaker, it\u2019s certainly for analog or Orange Amp enthusiasts.Photo by Jon Turi / Engadget\nIf you plan to travel with your speaker, you may want to consider getting the $60 Gigbag carrying case since there\u2019s no IP rating or waterproofing for the device.The mechanical \u2018thunk\u2019 of the on/off toggle is satisfying, while the domed orange power light seems pleasantly retro.It\u2019s a proper piece of equipment that you should be able to enjoy for a long time.And if you\u2019re used to watching the battery levels, it will be a bit of a mystery until you\u2019re at 10 percent power.Next to the domed power indicator is a battery level light that\u2019s red as it's charging, green when it\u2019s full and flashes red if the battery is at 10 percent or lower, with nothing in between.I tested the speaker at a relatively high volume for an hour, plus 10 hours at medium and two overnight stretches powered off.There\u2019s both digital Class D and A/B analog amps that deliver crisp and punchy front-facing sound from the 4-inch sub and dual 2-inch high frequency drivers.I didn\u2019t notice any distortion when pushing it to the max, but that overload light is a subtle hint to always check your levels.You\u2019ll also find an orange overload indicator light, which could become a common sight if you like to play your music loudly, especially with heavy bass.I\u2019ve personally come to enjoy the bohemian design and bright orange exterior, which is a refreshing change from what you\u2019d usually find.Although when testing on a large windy rooftop area, it didn\u2019t project as much if you\u2019re 15-20 feet away.On the plus side, there\u2019s obviously the analog amps on board and aptX support sweetens the deal.I can imagine lots of people with those turntables in luggage cases hooking up the speaker (although make sure you have good needles people).There\u2019s a relatively wide frequency range from 35Hz to 20kHz and aptX support is a huge plus, especially if you have access to hi-res streaming.You can charge the 2,600mAh battery for up to around 15-hours of playback or you can just run it while it\u2019s plugged in.It won\u2019t go to sleep even if you\u2019ve disconnected Bluetooth, so the battery may slowly drain if you leave it on all night without charging.It\u2019s fairly loud for its size and can handle small outdoor get togethers well if you just need background music.Although we haven\u2019t seen the bag in person, I expect it should at least help keep the speaker dry and clean when you\u2019re not using it.Like any speaker, if you\u2019re planning a long outing, you should keep the power cable handy.For eco-conscious consumers, the authorized service centers and replacement parts on offer until 2030 means you can actually repair the speaker if something happens to it.As long as you don\u2019t have too many other requirements, that is.Orange has been making guitar amps since the 1960s and it\u2019s apparently not changing the formula to compete against commonplace plastic Bluetooth speakers with all the mod cons.Hardware\nThe hardware elements and iconography from the company\u2019s long history of amps and speakers have been merged into this portable battery powered version.If that does happen, you do have the benefit of contacting an authorized repair center instead of having to cut your losses.Aside from that, there\u2019s a 3.5mm minijack on the top and an DC charging port on the back.If you\u2019re looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker that puts natural-sounding analog audio at the forefront, then you\u2019ll enjoy the Orange Box.The Orange Box, its $60 Gigbag carrying case and the slightly larger non-portable sibling the Orange Box-L ($345) are all currently available from the Orange Amps website.The dial positions are a little hard to read, though, unless you\u2019re standing directly above them since the position dot on the dial is near the bottom.I know the design isn\u2019t new since the Orange Amps style has hardly changed since the \u201860s, but for me it feels like a refreshing change of pace.Also, if you need a tiny DJ monitor, there\u2019s no processing delay when using the 3.5mm input jack, so you can mix by ear if needed.Features\nSome features that many have grown used to using aren\u2019t available on the Orange Box and if you just want something to play tunes, it\u2019s not a big deal.Photo by Jon Turi / Engadget\nThere are manual volume and EQ dials on the top panel.The Bluetooth control has a blue light that flashes when it\u2019s in pairing mode and does double-duty as a pause/play control.You\u2019ll just have to trust Orange Amps\u2019 build quality.The orange Tolex (vinyl) exterior, logo badge, speaker mesh, wood framing, dials, toggle switches, indicator lights and other details are a perfect match with the brand\u2019s existing stable of products.At $299 the Orange Box isn\u2019t terribly expensive and it feels less disposable than many of the products out there.The 50-watt speaker puts out enough volume to work well as a personal boombox in the park or around the house.It\u2019s hard to say if the sound or style will appeal to everyone, but it\u2019s great to have another option available, especially one that\u2019s built and sold by a brand with a legacy.Most styles of music sound good on the Orange Box, but the speaker really shines with songs that have live instrumentation or anything that can benefit from an analog touch.Sound\nThe best part about the Orange Box is its warm and bright output.However, there\u2019s no app for the speaker and it doesn\u2019t support multipoint or pairing with a second Orange Box for more sound.You do have to deal with losing some useful features and it\u2019s less rugged than some other portables, but the audio quality is a standout.Oh, and you can also get them in black if that\u2019s your preference.There\u2019s a shoulder strap option as well, and while the Orange Box is portable, it\u2019s still over 6.5 pounds.It\u2019s only when you have the overload light on constantly that you could get distortion and potentially damage the drivers.You could always save some money though, since it does fit into a backpack easily enough.The Bluetooth 5.0 range is as good or better than some other speakers in this category.The output has decent bass that does reverberate through its case, especially if you\u2019re near to it.Specs\n\nStyle: Orange peel Tolex, acoustically transparent grille\nDrivers: 1 x 4-inch bass driver, 2 x 2-inch high frequency

            "paraphrased_content": "\"Indeed, the number of companies developing custom chips for datacenters is skyrocketing these days.Amazon and Google developed plenty of their own designs to address their specific needs and Apple of course has dozens of SoCs and chips powering its consumer electronics devices.\"Specifically, there is demand [for chips] from data centers [and] right now, TSMC is the only company that can make the semiconductors they envision.\"We are looking for a U.S. partner, and we have begun discussions with some GAFAM [Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft] corporations,\" said Atsuyoshi Koike, chief executive of Rapidus, in an interview with\u00a0Nikkei.Equipping a fab with top-notch equipment is tremendously expensive, which is why Rapidus estimates that it is going to need around $35 billion to start making 2nm chips in 2027.In a bid to recoup production node R&D costs and fab costs, one needs to produce a boatload of chips on a leading-edge node and Japanese companies may not generate significant demand for such parts.\"It remains to be seen whether 5 to 10 companies can generate enough demand to recoup tens of billions of dollars that Rapidus will need to invest to start 2nm production in 2027.All of these companies use TSMC since the company has the most competitive process technologies and since they can leverage their IP across different product lines.Apparently, Rapidus wants to land orders from at least one these companies \u2014 which is not an impossible endeavor, since in addition to conglomerates like Apple and Google, there are other hyperscalers that need custom silicon and they may choose Rapidus over TSMC or Samsung Foundry if the former can offer a competitive production technology, good yields, and a competitive price.Interestingly, Rapidus is not looking forward serving dozens of companies, but only intends to serve five to 10 clients.Which is why Rapidus needs to land orders from a multinational like Apple or AWS.Meanwhile, winning even five customers with significant 2nm orders in 2027 will be quite difficult, since the number of companies willing to invest in designs to be made on a leading-edge node is fairly limited.Then again, from Japanese government point of view, Rapidus is meant to rejuvenate the leading-edge semiconductor supply chain in the country \u2014 so even if the company's 2nm node does not turn out to be a triumph, it will still pave the way for successors and open new doors to local chip designers.Rapidus, a semiconductor consortium backed by the Japanese government and industrial conglomerates, plans to start high-volume production of chips on its 2nm fabrication process in 2027.\"Our business model is not that of TSMC, which manufactures for every client,\" said Koike.That is where Rapidus will enter.In a bid to ensure that all of its production capacity is used, Rapidus wants to land orders from at least one global company, essentially competing with TSMC and other foundries.\"We will start with around five companies at most, then eventually grow to 10 companies, and we'll see if we'll increase the number beyond that.But at the same time, Rapidus does not plan to be like TSMC.Modern fabrication technologies costs billions of dollars to develop and while IBM, which is helping Rapidus with its 2nm manufacturing process has done a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to materials research and other time-consuming things, Rapidus will still have to do a lot.",

            "paraphrased_content": "As Ormandy explained, to abuse Zenbleed, the attacker needs local access to the target system, and extensive specialization and knowledge.AMD has since released a microcode update available on this link.We\u2019ll just have to wait for the benchmarks to arrive.What have others said about Zenbleed?In Ormandy\u2019s Twitter thread, users mostly praised the researcher\u2019s work, with one person even claiming they were \u201ceasily able to retrieve memory contents of the Windows host via WSL.\u201d Others weren\u2019t that impressed, as one user said the whole thing felt \u201clike someone\u2019s jumped the gun\u201d: \u201cNo vendor bios updates I can find, no distro has the microcode ready, we're having to resort to the chicken bits-- this smells.\u201dBleepingComputer, on the other hand, left nothing to chance, telling its readers that \u201cit's essential to keep systems up-to-date with the latest security patches and apply any BIOS updates as soon as they become available.\u201d CloudFlare chimed in to say some of its servers are using AMD\u2019s Zen line of CPUs and that it\u2019s patched its entire fleet to mitigate the potential vulnerability.In other words, hackers using this vulnerability can stay under the radar while exfiltrating sensitive information.As encryption keys are used to decrypt sensitive information such as passwords, they are considered a holy grail for hackers and threat actors.\u201cThat is fast enough to monitor encryption keys and passwords as users login!\u201d.As per The Hacker News, Ormandy is part of Google\u2019s Project Zero, the search engine\u2019s cybersecurity arm known for its research into state-sponsored actors.That doesn\u2019t make it any less dangerous, though, as criminals will go to great lengths to extract valuable data from organizations.Via: Tom\u2019s HardwareIf \u201cspeculative execution\u201d rings a bell, it\u2019s because the same technique was used in the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities.What makes Zenbleed even more dangerous is the fact that it\u2019s almost impossible to detect, as improper use of \u201cvzeroupper\u201d doesn\u2019t warrant elevated privileges or special system calls.It\u2019s a common practice used by most silicon OEMs these days, to make the chips run faster.The exploit is similar to the dreaded Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities, which also leveraged flaws during speculative execution.In any case, the vulnerability makes the CPU leak data \u201cat about 30 kb per core, per second,\u201d the researcher explains.\u201cWhile our network is now protected from this vulnerability, we will continue to monitor for any signs of attempted exploitation of the vulnerability and will report on any attempts we discover in the wild,\u201d it said in a writeup.Go deeperIf you want to learn more, make sure to read our \u201cWhat is encryption?\u201d article, as well as our explainer on why encryption matters to your organization.The vulnerability, since confirmed by AMD, is tracked as CVE-2023-20593 and at press time has not yet been rated.This time around, AMD was more careful, suggesting that the patch could affect the device\u2019s performance.Often, other sensitive data such as personal photos, emails, instant messaging, and business-related documents, can also sometimes be protected with an encryption key, meaning the ramifications of such an attack are quite extensive.In a statement shared with Tom\u2019s Hardware, the company said: \u201cAny performance impact will vary depending on workload and system configuration.When news of the flaws first broke, hardware manufacturers rushed to release a patch, and many failed.The manufacturer has since released a patch for the vulnerability and urged its users to apply it quickly and minimize the chances of being targeted.The flaw was discovered by Google\u2019s security researcher Travis Ormandy.His analysis focused on AMD Zen 2 CPUs, and said it \u201ctook a bit of work\u201d.However, he managed to discover improper handling of an instruction called \u201cvzeroupper\u201d during speculative execution.Some AMD chips are vulnerable to a high-severity security flaw that allows threat actors to steal sensitive data from the endpoint, including passwords and encryption keys.AMD is not aware of any known exploit of the described vulnerability outside the research environment.\u201dSo, we can expect some impact, although AMD is not yet comfortable sharing any details, or even generalizing on the topic.The silver lining with Zenbleed is that it\u2019s quite impractical to use, especially against regular users.Also, make sure to read our in-depth guide on the best encryption software right now, and best ways to share files securely.The vulnerability affects all AMD chips built on the Zen 2 architecture, meaning endpoints powered by the Ryzen 3000 (\"Matisse\"), Ryzen 4000U/H (\"Renoir\"), Ryzen 5000U (\"Lucienne\"), Ryzen 7020, and the high-end ThreadRipper 3000 and Epyc server (\"Rome\") processors are all vulnerable.What\u2019s more, the flaw can be used for any system operation, including those happening in virtual machines and isolated sandboxes.The result made endpoints sluggish, and some were even completely bricked.Alternatively, users can wait for their computer vendor to add the fix to a future BIOS upgrade.The flaw was first reported to AMD in mid-May 2023, and a proof-of-concept exploit (PoC) is already available, dubbed \u201cZenbleed\u201d.Analysis: Why does it matter?Any vulnerability that allows hackers to use malware to steal encryption keys is by default extremely dangerous.",

            "paraphrased_content": "SIA has a three point plan, and we have quoted the bullet points verbatim, below.Strengthen support for regional partnerships and programs aimed at growing the pipeline for skilled technicians for semiconductor manufacturing and other advanced manufacturing sectors.Grow the domestic STEM pipeline for engineers and computer scientists vital to the semiconductor industry and other sectors that are critical to the future economy.Retain and attract more international advanced degree students within the US economy.Hopefully, the above will be heeded by national and local government, and key industry players, and prove to be enough to help fill the talent gap - or if not it at least make things more manageable.Some of the news coming out of TSMC's big venture into the US, propelled by the CHIPS Act, isn't very encouraging for those who might be interested in working in the industry.These are huge numbers, and for industries like semiconductors, which have been judged to be one of strategic importance to the country, the issue is most concerning.Making clear the core issue, SIA says that current degree completion rates mean that roughly 67,000 - or 58% of projected new jobs - will go unfilled.This insufficient qualified labor problem isn't isolated to the semiconductor industry in the US.For example, in June, we reported on TSMC chairman Mark Liu saying workers in the industry should expect long shifts, and have their passion for the industry tested by the work environment.That means the total workforce of roughly 345,000 people today should expand to 460,000 by the end of the decade to keep pace.Of these about 1.4 million are at risk of being unfilled.Looking at the wider jobs market for a moment, SIA says that by the end of the decade an estimated 3.85 million additional US jobs requiring proficiency in technical fields will be created.However, the problems we are already seeing, regarding the lack of qualified and interested staff, look set to get worse.This came after news that TSMC was struggling to hire local workers in Arizona, so was seeking more Taiwanese migrants to fill the gaps.(Image credit: SIA)So, what is to be done to address the gap between the number of skilled chip industry workers expected to be needed, and the number that are expected to become available?The enactment of the landmark CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 means that the US will be responsible for a significant share of global semiconductor output, going forward.The labor market is going to struggle to keep up, though.(Image credit: SIA)SIA expects the semiconductor industry\u2019s workforce will grow by nearly 115,000 jobs by 2030.Key roles that will be difficult for US-based chipmakers to fill include technicians, computer scientists, engineers.In a report published by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today, it was estimated that there will be a shortfall of 67,000 workers in the industry, by 2030.Thus, SIA has devised a three point action plan to address the talent gap.The US has big ambitions for its domestic semiconductor industry, even going so far as encouraging foreign investment from the likes of Samsung and TSMC.",

            "paraphrased_content": "The Exorcist: Believer is slated to hit theaters on October 13th.Set in the same continuity as the original film, The Exorcist: Believer tells the story of how widower Victor Fielding (Leslie Odom Jr.) struggles to save the life of his young daughter Angela (Lidya Jewett) after she and her friend Katherine (Olivia Marcum) vanish suddenly one day only to reappear days later seemingly possessed by demonic entities.Victor doesn\u2019t need any prior experience with the supernatural to tell that something\u2019s amiss with the girls after they both show up with little memory of where they\u2019ve been, and Angela takes to sneaking up behind him in the middle of the night to say strange things.Only time will tell whether that also ends up being the case with Universal and Blumhouse\u2019s new trilogy of Exorcist features from director David Gordon Green, but the first trailer for The Exorcist: Believer definitely makes it seem like the revival\u2019s cooking with gas.But when the girls begin to be overcome with convulsions and start speaking in inhumanly resonant, feral voices, some part of Victor knows that his neighbor\u2019s (Ann Dowd) advice to seek out someone familiar with possessions is on the money.Though Warner Bros.\u2019 1973 adaptation of The Exorcist is an iconic piece of horror cinema, none of the studio\u2019s subsequent sequels ever really managed to make all that much of a splash.It\u2019s interesting to see that Believer\u2019s story will revolve around two possessions that have some sort of common thread and touch on spiritual practices outside of Catholicism that deal with demonic expulsion.But given how much of an influence the original Exorcist has had on the horror genre and its possession-focused subset, The Exorcist: Believer\u2019s success is likely going to hinge on just how well it\u2019s able to truly unsettle and disturb audiences.As delicious as it is to hear snippets of \u201cTubular Bells\u201d sprinkled throughout the trailer, it\u2019s even better to see Ellen Burstyn return as an older, wiser Chris MacNeil, who remembers well what it took to expel a demon from her own daughter.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Rivian isn\u2019t the first automaker to commit to buying clean energy through a virtual PPA.Rivian does not share its emissions data with CDP, a nonprofit that evaluates companies\u2019 environmental reporting.A virtual power agreement for the company\u2019s current and future customers, which Scaringe estimates will continue to grow as the company\u2019s production capabilities mature.Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said companies that want to use clean energy but don\u2019t commit to helping build new capacity are \u201cgreenwashing.\u201d Image: Getty\n\nLocated on top of a ridge in eastern Kentucky, the Starfire mine at one point saw hundreds of miners hauling millions of tons of coal each year.But \u201c90 percent\u201d of Rivian\u2019s emissions are Scope 3 \u2014 its fleet of electric R1T trucks, R1S SUVs, and EDV delivery vans.\u201cIf companies aren\u2019t making the commitment to purchase the power, which then makes the project financeable, these projects won\u2019t happen,\u201d he said.Rivian is targeting its Scope 1 emissions, from its factory and corporate offices, in part by putting up a wind turbine at its plant in Normal, Illinois.\u201cThis is just so conceptually complex,\u201d he said, making a clear distinction between companies that buy renewable energy to cover their own emissions while also creating new capacity and those who want to \u201cpay a teeny little incremental amount more to get the ability to pat ourselves on the back and say we\u2019re using renewable energy.\u201d\n\nScaringe puts Rivian firmly in the category of companies that not only want to eliminate their own carbon emissions but also help create new capacity for renewable energy to be created.Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge\n\nScaringe said that Rivian is working toward \u201cScope 3 neutrality,\u201d meaning it has the goal of eliminating all of its indirect emissions from its supply chain and the lifecycle of the EVs it produces.There is a growing chorus of environmental advocates demanding more transparency from corporations around the full picture of their carbon emissions.But the company still needs to go further.\u201cThere\u2019s far too much greenwashing in the system,\u201d he said in a recent interview.\u201cA few years from now, the carpark of Rivians will be consuming more energy than the entire country of Ireland.\u201dTo that end, he\u2019s in Kentucky on Tuesday to announce Rivian\u2019s support for a new solar energy center to be built on top of a former coal mine.In 2021, for example, corporations bought a record 31.1GW of clean energy, equivalent to more than 10 percent of all new renewable energy capacity added worldwide\u00a0that year.But soon, it will be the site of a massive solar farm with the goal of creating 800 megawatts (MW) of energy \u2014 enough to power 160,000 homes each year.And those emissions are why the company is agreeing to buy 100MW of energy from the solar farm in Kentucky, in addition to other PPAs.Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe is fed up with companies exaggerating their environmental credentials.A common criticism of EVs is that they are only as clean as their power source \u2014 in other words, if an EV is charging from a grid that primarily gets its power from a polluting source, like coal, then it can\u2019t claim to be a truly clean mode of transportation.Rivian will be an offtaker for the project, or a purchaser of the power generated from the site.Scope 2 emissions, from its electricity use, will have to be handled through the creation of \u201can upstream supply that will help offset\u201d the emissions created by Rivian\u2019s suppliers, Scaringe said.\u201cWe create the supply that offsets the usage of our collective fleet and the fleet as it grows, it becomes a big consumer of energy,\u201d he said.Nonetheless, Rivian says the energy will help \u201cpower up to 450 million miles of renewable driving every year.\u201d\n\nRivian will be an offtaker for the project, or a purchaser of the power generated from the site\n\nVirtual PPAs are becoming an increasingly popular form of clean energy commitment for American companies.The auto industry would need to play a stronger role in increasing renewable energy in power grids and reducing greenhouse gas emissions across its entire supply chain.The company authored a report earlier this year, along with Polestar, arguing that EVs alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to limit global temperature increases.The EV company is not directly funding the project, which is estimated to cost $1 billion, but it is committed to buying 100MW of energy as part of a virtual power purchase agreement (PPA) \u2014 virtual because the clean energy won\u2019t be flowing directly into Rivian\u2019s electric trucks, SUVs, or vans, or even the company\u2019s corporate offices or factories.And consumers aren\u2019t discerning enough to tell the difference.Ford, for example, has garnered \u201cA\u201d\u00a0grades\u00a0for its climate change disclosures since 2019, while Tesla earned \u201cF\u201d grades.Virtual PPAs are \u201ceasily scalable and enable buyers to satisfy a large portion of their sustainability goals with a relatively small number of deals,\u201d the Rocky Mountain Institute wrote in a 2019 report.Rivian may not be financing the solar project directly, but it is ensuring that there will be a market for the energy when the photovotalic cells come online.For Scaringe, it\u2019s all too easy for a company to obfuscate the source of its power consumption, especially when it doesn\u2019t actually create any new capacity for renewable energy.According to Scaringe, without these PPAs, many of these renewable energy projects wouldn\u2019t be able to get off the ground\n\nRivian has been at the forefront of the debate over electric vehicles and climate change, criticizing its competitors as being \u201cfar off track\u201d on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a way that can meet targets set by the Paris agreement.Stellantis signed a 400MW agreement with DTE Energy in Michigan late last year, while Mercedes-Benz said it would buy 140MW from an offshore wind farm in the Baltic Sea.Over half of the agreements came from tech giants, including Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google.BrightNight, a Florida-based solar company, is also building a 10-mile transmission line to enable an additional one gigawatt of power capacity for the future.According to Scaringe, without these PPAs, many of these renewable energy projects wouldn\u2019t be able to get off the ground.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Barra said in a letter to shareholders that despite hitting its 50,000 EV unit production goals for the first half of the year, GM is \u201ctaking steps to lower our capital spending,\u201d aiming to cut operating costs by an additional $1 billion by the end of 2024.GM\u2019s president of North America, Rory Harvey, claimed that the only supply chain issue impacting production was regarding battery module capacity and said he anticipates \u201ca lot more EVs being built in the second half of this year.\u201d\n\nAt present, Ultium batteries are only used in a handful of GM vehicles \u2014 including the Cadillac Lyriq SUV, the $90,000 GMC Hummer, and delivery vans under the automaker\u2019s BrightDrop subsidiary brand.According to the company\u2019s Q2 2023 earnings report this morning, GM made a profit of $2.6 billion between April and June, up from $1.7 billion in the same period last year.The delays in rolling out the new battery tech don\u2019t seem to be having a significant impact on GM\u2019s cash intake.Some of that cash has been sunk into building Ultium battery cell plants in the US \u2014 the batteries are being produced at a $2.3 billion joint production facility in Ohio that GM established with LG Energy, with two additional facilities under construction in Tennessee and Michigan.That initial 400,000 unit deadline was already pushed back to 2024 in October last year due to issues with battery production.Back in February 2022, Barra announced the automaker\u2019s plan to deliver 400,000 electric vehicles in North America through 2023, with the ambitious goal of producing 1 million EVs in the region by 2025.The company announced plans to invest tens of billions of dollars to develop its Ultium batteries when it first unveiled its modular EV platform back in 2020.According to a report published by The New York Times on Tuesday, most of the 50,000 EVs produced by GM in the first half of this year still use older third-party batteries, and GM has sold fewer than 2,800 vehicles in the US that utilize its new Ultium battery packs.GM CEO Mary Barra said during the company\u2019s Q2 earnings call that the new Bolt will be brought to market on \u201can accelerated timeline\u201d but didn\u2019t provide specific details regarding a launch date for the affordable EV after GM announced in April that it would stop manufacturing the original model that was plagued by fires and an expensive battery recall.\u201cOur customers love today\u2019s Bolt.\u201cWe will keep the momentum going by delivering a new Bolt\u2026and we will execute it more quickly compared to an all-new program with significantly lower engineering expense and capital investment by updating the vehicle with Ultium and Ultifi technologies.\u201d\n\nOngoing supply issues are reportedly hindering GM\u2019s production of Ultium batteries\n\nThe missing launch date is another reminder of ongoing supply issues that are reportedly slowing down GM\u2019s production of Ultium batteries.Overall revenue for the second quarter also jumped by almost 20 percent, from $35.8 billion last year to $44.7 billion.During a conference call with reporters on Monday, GM chief financial officer Paul Jacobson said that \u201cit\u2019s been a little bit challenging\u201d but claims that the company is still on target to make 100,000 EVs in the second half of 2023 as it ramps up production.Earlier this month, the Detroit Free Press reported that battery production was being hindered by extensive issues with its supply chain.It has been delivering record sales and some of the highest customer satisfaction and loyalty scores in the industry,\u201d said Barra.The opening of additional battery production facilities in Tennessee and Michigan is expected to alleviate sluggish production\n\nGM has spent a lot of money on its EV development.General Motors announced today that it\u2019s developing a next-generation Chevrolet Bolt based on the automaker\u2019s Ultium battery and drive technology to deliver \u201cgreat affordability, range and technology.\u201d It\u2019s following three electric vehicles Chevrolet is already scheduled to launch this year: the Equinox and Blazer SUVs and the Silverado pickup truck.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon is sure to have solid combat and gameplay, it is a FromSoftware title after all, but what about variety?Thankfully, it seems that won\u2019t be the case, as the latest gameplay footage released by FromSoftware and Bandai Namco shows off an impressively varied game.Over the course of 12 minutes of footage, we see a wide array of different maps, ranging from pristine mountains, to frozen tundra, dusty deserts, and, of course, more of those industrial backdrops.The freedom to play Armored Core with as quick or slow of an AC as you want makes for a vastly different experience than the typical Souls games that From Software has been working on for the better part of two decades and Fires of Rubicon certainly feels tuned towards a faster, more mobile playstyle.\u201d\nArmored Core VI Fires of Rubicon touches down on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on August 25.We also see lots of varied gameplay \u2013 in addition to combat against standard enemies, we see protagonist \u201c621\u201d take on a massive mechanical walker (think an AT-AT from Star Wars, except 10x bigger), other Armored Core mechs, and aggressive bosses.Related StoryKai PowellArmored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon Hands-On (PC) Preview \u2013 Might Makes Right\nWccftech\u2019s Kai Powell recently had a chance to go hands-on with Armored Core VI, tackling the game\u2019s entire first chapter, consisting of 11 missions.Until now, most of the footage we\u2019ve seen has taken place in somewhat similar-looking industrial-style environments, raising the prospect that Armored Core VI may be fun, but a bit repetitive overall.Players have a full 360 of movement to approach combat and some fights seem better suited for an aerial approach (a truck-based enemy unit was all but impervious to attacks from straight ahead with its weak points located on the rear heat vents).Definitely check out his full preview \u2013 meanwhile, here\u2019s just a snippet about the game\u2019s combat\u2026\n\u201cThe combat in Fires of Rubicon is just as fast-paced as the trailers have teased so far.Share this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n TwitterYou can check out the footage for yourself, below.All this is vividly rendered, with crisp details and impressive environmental effects, as it seems any concerns AC6 won\u2019t deliver on a technical level are misplaced.Depending on energy consumption and the power of the equipped generator, players might be able to dash nearly indefinitely or in much shorter controlled bursts.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Loyalty isn\u2019t an aspect that players should get too involved with early on in Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon.Any parts purchased from the shop can be sold back for a full refund.Let us know in the comments below!With the promise of more than thirty ranks of fights, players will face off against a variety of AC builds and enemies as they climb the ranks.The opening acts of Armored Core VI start with a brief bit of player customization in terms of name and moniker before your mission handler sends you out on your first mission: to scavenge up a non-expired ID in order to gain access to mercenary opportunities.Whether these passive systems replace a proper Human PLUS system is yet to be seen.The wait for Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon is nearly upon us, with the latest FROM Software-developed title ready to launch across both PlayStation and both Xbox generations of consoles in addition to PC on August 25th, 2023.If players find that a new shoulder weapon doesn\u2019t perform like intended or is too much of an energy vampire on their limited generator, there isn\u2019t a downside to ditching those components and trying something else out instead.Depending on energy consumption and the power of the equipped generator, players might be able to dash nearly indefinitely or in much shorter controlled bursts.Share this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n TwitterFrom that point on, the game opened up with a variety of basic tutorial missions, a story mission, more tutorials, and side missions until a total of eleven missions were available to play.Assembling my AC was relatively straightforward, with only a handful of armor pieces and weapons to customize my ideal build.There\u2019s no need to be loyal to just a single brand of AC parts, just as much as there isn\u2019t loyalty towards a certain faction in the world.2 of 9\n\nThe combat in Fires of Rubicon is just as fast-paced as the trailers have teased so far.In fact, after unlocking the Arena and taking out enough combatants to unlock chip data, I purchased an expansion ability that would allow my AC to stock a second set of left/right-hand weapons in lieu of shoulder weapons.Another passive I tried out was the ability to launch into a sortie while over-encumbered, although I didn\u2019t get to properly find a use for it as I would have in prior Armored Core titles.As suspected during an earlier preview, melee weapons are exclusive to the left hand.Do you have a particular build you enjoyed in previous Armored Core titles that you want to assemble in Fires of Rubicon?Players have a full 360 of movement to approach combat and some fights seem better suited for an aerial approach (a truck-based enemy unit was all but impervious to attacks from straight ahead with its weak points located on the rear heat vents).Chips are also earned through each Arena victory which can be slotted in as part of the deeper customization available to the player even as early as the first chapter.Customization and experimentation have been a central focus of the franchise, and Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon stays the course.It wouldn\u2019t be a proper Armored Core title without an Arena to fight through.These chips offer both active expansions and passive abilities (such as the weapon purge and second-arm weapon sets mentioned above).I leaned heavily towards just a pair of straightforward missile launchers because of the high amounts of raw damage and stagger damages each should deal.Each story mission took place either on its own map or an expanded range on a prior map.Sadly, no hints of PVP were visible during the preview session, but recent word has gone out for a possible six-player PVP mode.Players can still grind out as they see fit (which is something that I did on a side mission that was simply a duel against a low-skilled AC pilot and earned something around the tune of 30-50k credits on a given run) and work towards that shiny new set of tank legs that they might want for a mere 350k credits.Players will ally themselves alongside a variety of factions during the first chapter of the story and see the need for mercenary AC pilots across a variety of mission scenarios and different handlers along the way.Bandai Namco recently invited Wccftech out to a hands-on preview event to experience the full first chapter of Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon ahead of its August release.One of my favorite abilities unlocked was merely giving my AC an attack at the end of a forward boost dash: a frontal kick that delivered a heavy amount of stagger damage.Our sessions were all played on PCs with no limitations on what could be played up through the end of the first chapter, although the footage captured was held to some capture restrictions.Side missions, however, reused existing maps and would sometimes be played from end to beginning to feel distinctively different from the story centerpieces.With some right-hand energy weapons having a single clip of ammunition, being able to purge that weapon in the heat of battle (dropping the encumbrance and energy drain, although this is also another customization chip that needs to be purchased) can boost the player\u2019s mobility during arena or PVP battles.Sure, the credit cost at the end of each mission would\u2019ve been much higher than if I settled for a simple ballistic rifle but the beauty of Armored Core has been adapting to one\u2019s playstyle.Players can demo their custom build through an AC Test directly from the Garage without having to sortie on a mission.Each AC bested not only bestows the player with a new rank but they can also take their emblem as their own.Active abilities function more like shields of various abilities, whether you want to leave a dome shield in one place or surround your AC in a weaker shield that follows as the AC dashes about.Related StoryNathan BirchArmored Core VI New Footage Shows Off Varied Maps and a Truly Gargantuan Boss FightThis was my first taste of seeing missions beyond that of the foundry mission that made up the bulk of the first hands-off preview session (which actually makes up the very first mission of the second chapter of Fires of Rubicon).The freedom to play Armored Core with as quick or slow of an AC as you want makes for a vastly different experience than the typical Souls games that From Software has been working on for the better part of two decades and Fires of Rubicon certainly feels tuned towards a faster, more mobile playstyle.What I didn\u2019t realize until recently is that weapons such as handguns and missile launchers have to be purchased in separate left and right-hand versions.Perhaps the introductory handler that provides the player with their first mission opportunities might not be the best option going forward.",

            "paraphrased_content": "That said, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do before Japanese indie developers can reach the international renown of their corporate compatriots.PixelJunk Eden was a minimalist, trippy platformer built around subdued tech house beats and organic visuals from Baiyon, a Kyoto-based artist and musician who loved games but had no prior experience in the industry.\u201cIf I\u2019m going to make a game and can\u2019t find anyone like Dylan in Kyoto, should I try to interview at a big company like Nintendo?\u201d Baiyon asks.However, several developers at BitSummit told me under the condition of anonymity that Sony was more actively seeking to strike deals for Japanese indie games than ever before.Since then, the Japanese industry has executed a remarkable turnaround.Or Death the Guitar, a tight, hyper-violent platformer where a musical instrument exacts revenge for the murder of its owner.You know, can you get on [Xbox] Game Pass?Even Nintendo looked to be in big trouble after the Wii U flopped immediately on launch.Maybe they could use a hand with the right connection to an artist, programmer, or publisher.So when will Japanese indies step up on the global stage?I\u2019ve often heard that midsize studios like No More Heroes developer Grasshopper Manufacture used to actively recruit foreign developers in large part to help with the lack of Japanese documentation for their basic technology, which is much less of an issue today.But Japanese games are more popular than ever, and there\u2019s clearly a well of talent here just waiting to be tapped.A vibrant PC gaming market is crucial to indie developers, who often rely on early access programs or releases that can exist outside of stores run by major platform operators.I could cite mobile megahits like Ojiro Fumoto\u2019s Downwell, revivalist successes like former Castlevania producer Koji Igarashi\u2019s Bloodstained, and viral breakouts like Masafumi Onuki\u2019s Fight Crab as solid representatives.No one would have predicted that trajectory \u2014 Sony famously passed on the publishing rights \u2014 but the game found its audience nonetheless.After dominating in the PlayStation 2 era, domestic studios struggled to adapt to the challenges and costs of developing for HD consoles like the PS3, which sold fewer than half as many units as its predecessor locally.The Steam Deck isn\u2019t exactly mass market, but as a portable device with console-style software, it\u2019s potentially the most accessible gaming PC ever to go on sale in Japan.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what\u2019s indie, what\u2019s AAA, what\u2019s in-between \u2014 nothing,\u201d Baiyon tells me.Another visible impact at this year\u2019s BitSummit was the widespread presence of the Steam Deck.This year\u2019s BitSummit was a really well-put-together event, with a strong mix of big-player publishers and solo exhibitors.The vibes were good, and it felt like something real might be starting, but the Japanese indie scene was clearly still in an embryonic form.That\u2019s what BitSummit is for.The event itself was professionally staged, and there are plans to expand to a whole other floor of the convention center next year.This year, we had a lot of good Japanese entries \u2014 really unique games.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong.\u201cEven within Sony, I\u2019d only ever make the kind of game that I\u2019d want to make,\u201d Kotani says.\u201cIf you get through that interview, Nintendo is agreeing to invest about two million quid into your life.Or Umbraclaw, a stylish tale of a dead cat making its way back home from the underworld.However, one thing I kept hearing from him and other developers at BitSummit is how tools like Unity and Unreal Engine have made a huge difference in recent years for aspiring indie developers \u2014 especially because of improved Japanese language support.I have no doubt there\u2019d be enough exhibitors to justify it.The PS4 and the Switch were both huge successes.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of difference in ideas or gameplay quality,\u201d says Davis.Ten years ago, a group of game developers in Kyoto started up an indie festival with the aim of promoting and uniting the country\u2019s fragmented independent scene.In many ways, Japanese developers have an even harder road to success \u2014 fewer publishers, fewer resources, and fewer potential customers.Demand in Japan has outpaced expectations, according to Yukie Adachi of Komodo, which handles official Steam Deck sales in Asia.It also can\u2019t go unmentioned that perhaps the most seminal indie game of all time, Daisuke Amaya\u2019s Cave Story, came from Japan.Maybe they just want to bounce ideas off someone.This is happening despite certain headwinds here, like a significantly delayed release leading to a higher price due to the yen\u2019s subsequent collapse against the US dollar.Look at Sky the Scraper, a terrifying 2D action game where you swing from window to window in order to clean a tower.You could see an experience gap between them [and Japanese developers], but that\u2019s shrinking.I would say it\u2019s more likely than not that there are countless Japanese indie developers working on games right now with the same sort of breakout potential.I\u2019m reminded of Demon\u2019s Souls, an unheralded action RPG that turned out to be one of the most influential games of the century and catapulted FromSoftware to international renown.But until recently, the path to indie game development has been harder for a lot of people here to imagine for themselves, not least because of technical challenges.\u201cI just wanted to have fun and try to make it until the end\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I talk to platform people here, they pull me aside and say, \u2018Hey, what\u2019s this game?\u2019\u201d says Davis, without referring to specific titles or companies.Those kind of things are so hard for indies \u2014 not just Japanese.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s worth keeping in mind.Can you get on the front page of Steam?One early highlight was the reveal of Ratatan, a spiritual successor to Sony\u2019s PSP rhythm-action hit Patapon.\u201cNintendo will do an interview and then they\u2019ll employ that person for the rest of their life,\u201d says Cuthbert.Or Algolemeth, a monochrome first-person dungeon crawler with a unique automated battle system that reminded me a little of Final Fantasy XII.Super Hexagon composer Chipzel put on a great live performance.Japanese games are as popular as they\u2019ve ever been.\u201cBut after I left, I still really wanted to work on games like Patapon, centered around my philosophy, so that\u2019s the only kind of development that I\u2019ve been involved in.\u201d Kotani is working on Ratatan with Patapon composer Kenmei Adachi and producer Kazuto Sakajiri; the art comes from illustrator Nelnal.Photography by Sam Byford for The VergeAnd very little on show at BitSummit seems to have been developed with a view to global domination.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people where this is their first BitSummit, and I think we\u2019ve made a great impression on them and shown why this show is different from Tokyo Game Show, or even other shows in the West.\u201d\n\nBitSummit announced that more than 23,700 visitors came to the show this year, its highest-ever attendance figure.Three of The Game Awards\u2019 last six Game of the Year winners were Japanese, and few would bet against Tears of the Kingdom raising that average this year.It\u2019s already become an essential event in the Japanese gaming calendar \u2014 and I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before its participants start to make more noise around the world.\u201cAnd those indies that can come here probably are either famous enough or can have a publisher pay for them.\u201cCan you get on Game Pass?\u201cThe publishers have been really happy, the developers have been really happy, and in that sense the show has been a big success,\u201d BitSummit co-founder John Davis told me as the show opened to the public on its second day.\u201cI feel like this year is the first time since 2019 that it\u2019s back to being the BitSummit we all know and love,\u201d Davis says, referencing the varying degrees to which the events of the past three years were limited by pandemic restrictions.\u201cI wanted to find some local artists who could come up with something visually unlike any other kind of game and that\u2019s when I met Baiyon,\u201d says Dylan Cuthbert, who founded Q-Games after a lengthy career in Japan involving stints at Sony and Nintendo.Original designer Hiroyuki Kotani tells me that he was inspired by his time at Sony\u2019s \u201cGame Yaroze!\u201d project, which auditioned new ideas for PlayStation games in the \u201990s.I went along to the second BitSummit the following year, and it turned out that more than 5,000 others had the same idea.It certainly helped that it was the first time since 2019 that overseas developers and media could easily visit Japan, but the focus on domestic talent was stronger than ever.But Japanese indies still don\u2019t regularly enter the zeitgeist in the same way that games like Neon White, Citizen Sleeper, or Vampire Survivors \u2014 just to name three from last year \u2014 often do in the West.What kind of marketing can you have?Several publishers turned their attention to handheld and mobile gaming.It was an appropriately ramshackle affair, with little to the staging beyond rows of tables in a gaping Kyoto convention center.Previously niche franchises like Yakuza and Persona have become household names, while Capcom is on an impressive run of revitalizing its own properties.Patapon was released through Sony\u2019s Japan Studio, which put out some of the most creative first-party output across several PlayStation generations, including hits like PaRappa the Rapper and LocoRoco.\u201cThis year, we had a lot of good Japanese entries \u2014 really unique games.\u201d\n\nThis was reflected in much stronger show floor representation from Japanese developers than in BitSummit\u2019s earlier years.For all the creativity on show, it does feel like there\u2019s less of an established pathway to find an audience than you might hope for from one of the world\u2019s biggest gaming markets.Sony made the controversial decision in 2021 to shutter the studio and pivot it around Astro Bot developer Team Asobi; any products from that plan are yet to be announced.\u201cIt\u2019s more about what kind of support you can have.\u201cIt was tough in the past because there are so many high quality indies from the West, right?\u201d says Davis, who is conscious of striking the right balance.\u201cBut I trusted myself and Dylan to see if we could make something cool.The Deck makes sense as a convenient way to show off games, of course, but it could have particular resonance in the Japanese market.One hundred seventy people officially showed up to the inaugural BitSummit in 2013, and organizers said they\u2019d aim for at least 200 people next time around.So it really changes your perspective because you\u2019ll never get fired from Nintendo unless you do something really stupid.\u201d\n\nOf course, you can go anywhere in Japan and find creative people like Baiyon \u2014 talented musicians, photographers, and painters who figure out how to make an independent living through their art.Or Unrestricted, a sleek superhero-style action RPG built in Unreal Engine.Back in 2014, though, the prevailing tone of discussion was that the entire Japanese games industry was in a bad place.The sheer volume of high-profile Western indie hits each year obscures the far larger number of games that fail to find an audience.There was a widespread sense that Sony is attempting to fill a gap in its publishing lineup.And it was fun for me, so I just wanted to have fun and try to make it until the end.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe conventional expectation for a path to employment in Japan remains much the same as it ever was: you study hard in high school to get into university and find a graduate job at a company that you will likely remain at for the rest of your career.Maybe that work is happening in their spare time away from their day job.Almost everyone I spoke to over the weekend expressed a similar sentiment.\u201cPublishers are the same way \u2014 they come here to find interesting games.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that for all the Japanese indie scene\u2019s progress, it\u2019s yet to have a big impact around the world.The majority of exhibitors had traveled from abroad.One of the first Japanese indie hits was Q-Games\u2019 PixelJunk Eden, which was released in 2008 for the PlayStation 3; the new PS5 version of Eden 2 was shown off at this year\u2019s BitSummit.There was a large official booth for Valve\u2019s PC gaming handheld, and it was also near-ubiquitous elsewhere as a standard demo device.The question I had going into last weekend\u2019s BitSummit, then, was how Japan\u2019s indie scene is doing in the face of all this blockbuster success.\u201cIt might be kind of fun just for a few weeks,\u201d he adds, hinting that it might not be a whole lot of fun for him beyond that.Adachi told me that the handheld was riding a wave of generally increased interest in PC gaming in Japan.Those kind of things are so hard for indies \u2014 not just Japanese.\u201d\n\nI thought this year\u2019s BitSummit was by far the most successful to date at presenting a strong case for the state of Japanese indie games.Official attendance set a new record, and the show felt a lot more diverse than typical game shows in Japan.Can you get on the front page of Steam?The local representation on the show floor was stronger than ever.That tied into the Net Yaroze development kit, allowing hobbyist developers to create their own PS1 games on an exclusive black version of the console.Japan\u2019s PC gaming scene, however, has historically been very niche, with consoles and particularly handheld systems dominating sales in recent decades.",

25L: One-minute reviewAs long as you\u2019re not looking for cutting-edge gaming, the HP Omen 25L is more than enough for your needs.And, they\u2019re all presented under different listings instead of a single \u201cHP Omen 25L\u201d page with whatever upgrades you want to choose from.The review model, unlike the cheapest configuration, sports an AMD CPU with Nvidia graphics, specifically an AMD Ryzen 7 5700G, 16GB, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, and a 512GB SSD with an additional 1TB hard drive.While we\u2019ve reviewed a robust configuration here, just about any version of this PC will give you great results whether you\u2019re escaping futuristic police in Cyberpunk 2077 or commanding fantastical armies in Total War: Warhammer III.Whether it\u2019s among the best gaming PCs out there somewhat depends unfortunately on the individual unit you get as there can be some quality control issues with more than a few.As with most customizable PCs from HP or other big manufacturers, the different configurations listed under the HP Omen 25L name are confusing and all over the place.RTS fans will be happy to hear that I was able to get an equally impressive 89 fps in Total War: Warhammer III with Ultra settings on.The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti still has easily reachable limitations, notably with higher resolutions.And, it does so at quite an affordable price.It helps that the PC is on the taller side, dwarfing HP\u2019s more budget-friendly Victus line.That all-white design is accentuated by an RGB diamond on the front, while the side glass panel allows you to ogle the internals in all its RGB glory.You can get models with Intel CPUs and Nvidia graphics, Intel CPUs and AMD graphics, AMD CPUs and Nvidia Graphics, and AMD CPUs and AMD graphics.And, if you\u2019re in Australia, you won\u2019t have access to this model.And, yes, there\u2019s plenty of lighting bling happening inside the case as well, including the fans and RAM sticks.Getting inside the chassis is pretty easy as that side panel can be removed with a push of a button.These wired peripherals do the trick for a while, but they feel cheap and don\u2019t come with any surprisingly robust features.$1,399.99 / \u00a0\u00a31,049.99 / about AU$2094.65\u00a0When is it available?Considering these are all customizable, you can certainly pick and choose what you find important.You won\u2019t be getting a mechanical keyboard in the deal.Design score: 4\u00a0/ 5(Image credit: Future / James Holland)HP Omen 25L: PerformanceSolid gaming performance in 1080pNot great for 4K gamingSome reported

from a PC with an AMD Ryzen 7 chip and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GPU, the 1080p performance is very solid, more than capable of handling just about any game you throw at it.Instead, you can either

Omen 25L cuts a striking almost monolith-like figure with its almost all-white design.Read our full HP Victus 15L reviewAlienware Aurora R15\nWhile a bit on the pricey side, even when getting a lower specced configuration, the Alienware Aurora R15 is a powerful and gorgeous looking desktop that will meet all your gaming needs.That price tag will net you a base configuration of a 13th-Gen Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT, and 256GB SSD.Available nowWhere can you get it?For example, going from a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 to the 3060 Ti is an additional $200.However, if you\u2019re in the UK, you\u2019re limited to two configurations, a 13th-Gen i5, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, 16GB RAM, and 1TB SSD for \u00a31,199.99 or an AMD Ryzen 5 5600G, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD for \u00a31,099.99.While I was testing the HP Omen 25L, I had it connected to a 4K monitor and was able to reach that limitation fairly quickly.As long as you don't end up with one, you\u2019ll get a solid 1080p gaming performance.3.5 / 5Average ratingThe HP Omen 25L is priced reasonably and delivers solid 1080p performance.I\u2019ve spent the last few years reviewing tech gear for gaming and otherwise, where I\u2019ve gotten a feel for what to look for and how to put a piece of kit through its paces to see whether it\u2019s worth the recommendation.You\u2019ll have to plug any USB-C peripherals into the back where there are just two on hand as well as four USB-A ports.I tried them at different graphics settings as well as different resolutions.Cyberpunk 2077 might be a few years old at this point, but it\u2019s still an incredibly popular game and one that needs a good amount of resources for good performance.Read our full Alienware Aurora R15 review\u00a0How I tested the HP Omen 25LI tested for a weekI played a variety of gamesI opened it up and checked out the internalsHaving used the HP Omen 25L for a week, I played a variety of games on it, including Far Cry 6, Battlefield 2042, and Cyberpunk 2077.Just be aware that upgrading the GPU or CPU is going to dramatically increase the price quickly.However, if you have one that performs as it should, you\u2019ll have little to complain about except for maybe wanting an extra port or two.(Image credit: Future / James Holland)Swipe to scroll horizontally[Product name]AttributesNotesRatingPriceYou can upgrade the HP Omen 25L to a very expensive configuration.I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an issue with quality control or if a bad batch hit the market, but this is one computer that you\u2019ll want to be up to date on what your warranty options are.Performance score: 3.5\u00a0/ 5Should you buy the HP Omen 25L?And, I\u2019ve spent even longer playing computer games so I have an understanding of what gamers look for to get the most out of their titles.Read more about how we testFirst reviewed July 2023I also opened the computer up and took a look around to see how easy it is to access the internals in case of issues.However, it\u2019s priced very reasonably and is on par with similarly specced models.4 / 5DesignThe HP Omen 25L is attractive with some RGB bling and comes with easy access to the internal components.4 / 5PerformanceUnfortunately, there are some lemons out there.So, the fact that this computer can deliver almost 86 fps on Ultra settings is pretty heartening.Plus, at its most basic configuration, it ranks among the best budget gaming PCs available.While I was able to get through a full campaign on Battlefield 2042 on medium settings, I experienced enough stuttering to make running it in 1080p much more preferable.Now, if you\u2019ve done any googling of this particular model in HP\u2019s gaming lineup, you\u2019ll probably see more than a few results regarding issues with it freezing and rebooting any time someone tries to run a game, which is most likely an issue with either the graphics card or the power supply.It also looks like a monolith in white and RGB lighting.4 / 5Buy it if...You want solid 1080p gaming\nThe HP Omen 25L can deliver where it counts for anyone wanting to game in 1080p gaming, even on max settings for many demanding games.You want an attractive and different-looking PC\nThis desktop looks like a monolith in white with RGB lighting.That said, there is a plastic placeholder covering the graphics card that you\u2019ll have to unscrew if you ever need to replace it.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Future / James Holland)(Image credit: Future / James Holland)(Image credit: Future / James Holland)(Image credit: Future / James Holland)As far as ports go, the selection is decent if not exceptional.This configuration goes for $1,902.99, though it is usually on sale as most of this PC\u2019s configurations.For the most kitted-out configuration, you\u2019re going to have to drop a cool $3,018.99 for the pleasure, which includes a 13th-gen Intel Core i7, 64GB RAM, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, and a 1TB SSD with an additional 1TB SSD for extra storage.On top of that, everything is pretty organized so you don\u2019t have to worry about navigating the PC\u2019s layout if you\u2019re trying to replace a part.HP does offer an optional keyboard and mouse for an extra $14 / about \u00a311.01, and their quality is worth about that.Not only is it attractive but in a way that\u2019s slightly different than many other PCs out there.Don't buy it if...You\u2019re on a budget\nWhile it\u2019s not egregiously priced, the HP Omen 25L is not a budget PC.HP Omen 25L: Price & availabilityHow much does it

            "paraphrased_content": "If there's an aim to make this, in particular, more fluid, then this would be music to the ears of a lot of existing fans, as well as a new audience.So, while there\u2019s still a lot to uncover about how exactly the remake will build upon the foundations set by the original, we aren\u2019t going in entirely blind.We\u2019ve still managed to scrape together all the information we do have, so here\u2019s everything we know about the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake.Mechanics such as healing were pretty challenging throughout the original and included a lot of in-menu work, but whether or not this will be among the elements being evolved is currently unknown.Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will come to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.Although the trailer showcased no in-game content or information regarding the storyline or a release date, it has been confirmed a remake is in the works and to be expected potentially in the next year or two.Titled Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and also being referred to as just 'Metal Gear Solid Delta', the information we have regarding the title right now is incredibly thin on the ground, but that hasn't stopped it from becoming one of the most anticipated upcoming games.MGS 3 serves as a prequel to the rest of the saga, and because of this, it lays out the origins of Big Boss, a major character within the series, and walks you through the infiltration of Soviet territory to prevent the construction of a weapon of mass destruction.What we can glean from the trailer though are a bunch of call-backs, nods, and 'easter eggs' which are great fun for existing fans to identify - even if we don't see any in-game action or mechanics.Almost twenty years after the release of the original, we expect the remake to recreate a similar experience while boasting more modernized mechanics and visuals.Though while we\u2019ve seen a trailer, that does contain a few good easter eggs and nods, we're yet to see any in-game action or details.We expect a 2024 release date, but with no window, it\u2019s a bit of a shot in the dark.The information we have on the release and content of the game is incredibly thin on the ground, so it could be a while before we receive any sort of update on the concrete release date.As confirmed in a Tweet posted on the official Metal Gear Solid page, MGS Delta: Snake Eater, is intent to be a \u2018faithful recreation of the original story and game design, while evolving the gameplay with stunning visuals and a seamless user experience.\u2019 Perhaps the game will get similar treatment to the Resident Evil remakes of recent years, with a full overhaul of the camera and mechanics to bring the game into the 21st century.The content of the original game was praised for being before its time, like thermal imaging, so we are keen to see how exactly these are adapted for a more beneficial user experience.Instead, it takes us through an animated rendition of the jungle landscape players of the original Metal Gear Solid 3 may recognize.We do expect that a lot of the general mechanics will remain the same to replicate the original experience to a more modern standard.Metal Gear Solid 3 remake news(Image credit: Konami)Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will contain all the original voices\nAs confirmed in a Tweet, all the original voices from the 2004 Metal Gear Solid 3 will be used in the remake.Whether or not it\u2019ll be available on day one on Xbox Game Pass is also yet to be announced - though news of this could come around, or after, a concrete release date is confirmed.The majority of the setting of Metal Gear Solid 3 is in a jungle in Russia, during the Cold War, which is echoed through the brief pan we receive in the announcement trailer.Rather than inviting voice actors back to re-record lines, the audio will be taken from the original game, which will feed into the honest recreation the remake promises to deliver.Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater announced as part of Sony\u2019s State of Play\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a remake of the 2004 Metal Gear Solid 3, was announced as part of Sony\u2019s State of Play on May 24, 2023.That said, we do know which platforms the game is set to arrive on, and surprisingly it\u2019s not a PlayStation exclusive.Metal Gear Solid 3 remake gameplay(Image credit: Konami)Similarly to the story, we expect the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake gameplay to stick pretty closely to the source material.For more games worth adding to your radar, we've got information on the Clockwork Revolution release date, or if you're looking for a more bleak adventure, the Lies of P release date is rapidly approaching.TBA\u00a0What can I play it on?That said, since it\u2019s revisiting the original MGS 3 game, there are a few conclusions we can draw based on what we already know.After following a colony of ants, followed by a bird in flight, and then a large snake and crocodile, we get our first glimpse at Snake.But, if you\u2019re among the players who are yet to experience what Metal Gear Solid 3 has to offer, and you\u2019d rather now wait for the remake rather than play the original, then the story is still worth brushing up on so you\u2019ll be able to experience the high-stakes action without having to learn too much on the spot.While the general premise of stealth missions and combat-heavy interactions is expected to continue, we do expect the newest reiteration of the game to feel more polished in comparison to its 2004 counterpart.That said, we haven\u2019t seen any of the gameplay yet, so there could be several mechanics that have been fine-tuned or adapted to make the experience more streamlined and up-to-date.But, now we\u2019ve received the first glimpse at a trailer, there are even more reasons to get excited about revisiting one of the most esteemed Metal Gear Solid titles to date.It becomes your job as 'Naked Snake' to carry out missions (as part of the larger mission at hand) translated through radio messages, boss fights, stealthy espionage action, and to avoid blowing your cover to do what's right.Even though you can use it to your advantage, the wilderness and its ferocious inhabitants are also ready to blow Snake\u2019s cover, so you need to stay alert at all times.A remaster of the esteemed Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater\u00a0When does it come out?PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC\u00a0Who is making it?Some specifically good nods are being able to make out the silhouette of the Shagohod in the clouds at the beginning, the parrot almost certainly being The End's companion bird, and the poison dart frog giving a nod to The Fear.Also, as well as the trailer, the official screenshots that have been released make for great viewing too: and importantly seem to indicate that environments and spaces won't be drastically changed, and will get the beautifying treatment while retaining their original layout, style, and features.Metal Gear Solid 3 remake story and setting(Image credit: Konami)With such a short trailer to go off, there\u2019s a huge amount to learn about the story and setting of the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake.Konami\u00a0Metal Gear Solid 3 remake release date and platforms(Image credit: Konami)Even though we know a game is in the works, the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake release date is yet to be announced.The Metal Gear Solid 3 remake release date is going to be hotly anticipated - and was so even before the official announcement of the game.Unfortunately, the game isn\u2019t going to receive any last-gen ports, so if you\u2019re still rocking older hardware, it might be worth looking to upgrade your setup prior to release if the game is a must-play for you.Metal Gear Solid 3 remake trailers(Image credit: Konami)We\u2019ve only received one Metal Gear Solid 3 remake trailer so far, and it doesn\u2019t give any information away regarding in-game content.Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake - Cut to the chase\u00a0(Image credit: Konami)What is it?The end of the trailer announces the name Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but we don\u2019t receive anything about platforms or a release date.With how highly-praised the original game was, there's a strong chance that once the remake arrives it could fall among not only the best games on Xbox Series X, but the best PS5 games too.In addition to setting up the series, MGS 3 is the first game (despite being a prequel) to stray from the traditional formula of Metal Gear Solid games in terms of its technology, relying more on using the wilderness to your advantage rather than leaning on and defending yourself against high tech.The story has been confirmed to remain the same as the original game, so if you\u2019ve already played the 2004 version, you\u2019ll probably know what to expect.",

perhaps a bug they need to fix in the app.I also tested it against my everyday smartwatch (a Fitbit Versa), to see if it tracked the same amount of calories and output.As a runner, I loved the separate app on the watch for different running activities, with everything from a timed basic walk or run to advanced intervals.The install process takes you through a variety of features, helping you sync your device and add in personal goals, from the number of calories you want to burn while you are exercising to the number of steps you want to achieve every day.I mostly used the watch as I sweated through spinning classes and it was great to see real-time statistics, however, it didn\u2019t provide me with anything different to the competition.It claims to have a 14-day battery life, but if you\u2019re using it regularly you will only get around a week out of it based on our tests.All of the best sleep trackers and sleep tracking apps break your sleep down into light, deep and REM cycles, and offer actionable advice for getting better sleep.3.5/5FeaturesMi Fitness has some cool stuff, but lack of detail holds it back.It looks and feels premium, but doesn\u2019t hold a huge amount of value unless you\u2019re a die-hard Xiaomi fan.You\u2019re a pro athlete\u00a0\nAre you a runner or cyclist and want to beat your PBs?The Sleep section of the app didn\u2019t provide much detail either, just giving me a score from \u2018poor\u2019 to \u2018good\u2019 without any details on how to improve or what those scores meant.The main reason for its size is its large watch face, all sapphire glass, paired with a stainless steel case.A feature which could rouse up some motivation between your group of friends, or cause an argument \u2013 providing you all have the S1 Pro.How I testedOur writer wore the Xiaomi Watch S1 Pro for over a month and used it during a variety of workouts, including runs and spin classes.The look of the watch is smart, with a choice between a black rubber strap or brown leather and a sapphire glass watch face with 1.47\" AMOLED screen \u2013 it\u2019s beaming with colorful apps, which are clear and easy to navigate.It's certainly attractive, looking more like a standard watch than a smartwatch.There were no niggles as I tried to open any of the features and we appreciated the quality,of the display, especially when I was out on a run .4/5VerdictIt\u2019s a fine watch, but some detail and accuracy problems, along with its large size and high price, mean it's not a must-buy.3.5/5Buy it if...You're a runner\nThe watch has multiple running options and workout modes, including a fat-burn run, intervals and conventional steady-state.You want a more traditional watch\nIf you want to pair your watch with your smart suit or a dress, the traditional leather strap will look right in place rather than a squircle shape and silicone band.Don't buy it if...You want an inconspicuous look\u00a0\nThis watch is big, it really stood out on my wrist and it doesn't make me want to wear it day-to-day.You want detailed stats\u00a0\nThe watch and app have very basic statistics and don\u2019t delve into the nitty-gritty.With over 100 exercises to track its inclusive, while it even has a separate running app, but its statistics are very basic and won\u2019t beat its competition.I also used the watch for hiking on a bright day and it really held its own - never letting me down when I wanted to check out stats as I hiked.You\u2019ll need a different, more exercise-orientated watch to help you achieve this.This will last you around a week, and up to 10 days if you don\u2019t use it too regularly.However, it's a chunky watch, with its watch face really standing out on the wrist.Fitbit, Samsung and even Pok\u00e9mon Sleep offer chronotype-based sleep profiles, so this is a huge content hole for Xiaomi.She compared its workout statistics to a contemporary Fitbit for accuracy, wore it overnight to test its sleep tracking capabilities, and hiked with it to examine its GPS credentials.The price is surprisingly high for what you get, especially compared to its contemporaries.The quality of the screen, 1.47\" AMOLED, is one of its best features, gliding through the apps and features effortlessly.We particularly liked the extras, which we haven\u2019t found on other smartwatches, such as skin temperature, a compass and even a flashlight, so you no longer have to rely solely on your phone.It\u2019s an expensive watch and really does look the part, but we\u2019d love to see a more lightweight version, as at times this felt quite heavy on the wrist.Like its predecessors, the Xiaomi Mi and Xiaomi S1, you can choose from a brown leather strap or a black silicone strap \u2013 I liked that the brown strap worked as a more formal accessory, and I was able to pair it with not just gym wear, but smarter outfits too.",

            "paraphrased_content": "During my testing that figure has proven to be fairly accurate, provided you're cruising slowly on a windless day.Two-minute reviewThanks to its dual cameras the DJI Air 3 has the potential to open up new creative avenues, making it an exciting drone to play with.The DJI Air 3 also offers excellent flight and safety features which never fail to impress \u2013 it makes total sense for DJI to focus on drone safety if it's to continue existing in a world of increasingly tough, varied and inconsistent drone regulations.To some this may seem of little use; after all, why would you need a zoom lens if you can simply fly the drone closer to the subject?The Air 3 uses the next-generation DJI 04 transmission system, which can transmit a 1080p/60fps live feed at a distance up to 20km (in the US, up to 10km in other regions including Europe).Keep in mind, though, that higher winds mean reduced battery life.Don't buy it if...This is your first drone\nA beginner would have no problem flying the DJI Air 3 \u2013 it's easy to operate and its safety features are excellent.Video can be recorded with both cameras offering 10-bit D-Log M and 10-bit HLG color modes; 10-bit D-Log M mode offers more flexibility in post production with respect to detail available in highlights and shadows, as well as color grading.How good is the camera\u2019s dynamic range; i.e.The Air 3 is positioned between the more affordable and feature-packed Mini 3 Pro, and the much more expensive but highly capable C2-category Mavic 3 Pro.The DJI RC 2 is a particularly welcome upgrade for anyone who's used the DJI RC, specifically in terms of range and signal.For European users a 5.1Ghz frequency band has been added to improve transmission performance; does this hint at the release later this year of an O4 Air Unit for FPV quadcopters to replace the current O3 Air Unit?However, it is still a large drone, with big propellers sitting within the C1 category.This allowed me to test its performance with high wind both in terms of flying and the stills and video I was able to capture in these less than ideal conditions.I flew it with and without obstacle avoidance, in a multitude of environments, from open fields to thick woodland.Flight features include Focus Track for both cameras, which keeps the subject at the centre of the frame, Quickshots (a set of creative camera movements), while video modes include 2.7K vertical shooting convenient for social media, Mastershots (generates fast effortless cinematic footage), Night Mode for low-light environments, Hyperlapse (4K horizontal / 2.7K vertical), Slow Motion up to 100fps at 4K, Smartphoto 3.0, QuickTransfer, Lightcut (one-tap video editing), and Waypoint Flights, available on the Air series for the first time.DJI Air 3: Image and video qualityDual camera (wide-angle and medium tele)Two 1/1.3-inch CMOS sensorsUp to 4K 100fps videoThe DJI Air 3 sports two cameras, each based on a 1/1.3-inch CMOS sensor.It was very windy with up to 35mph winds, except for one calmer day.Another benefit is when you need to capture anything at sea, perhaps a yacht, the zoom lens allows you to stay a little higher above the waves and still get the close-up footage you need.A zoom lens also offers the potential to compress the perspective of a scene by bringing elements at different distances closer together, opening up new creative possibilities.Image 1 of 10(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)I really like the ability to tilt the camera from 90 degrees downwards to 60 degrees upwards; it's another great tool for capturing footage that stands out, and a feature that Mini 3 Pro users will be familiar with.One important consideration is that both lenses have a fixed aperture: f/1.7 in the case of the wide-angle, and f/2.8 for the medium telephoto.This allows me to test their responsiveness and overall latency drops between the drone and the remote, depending on the surroundings.All testing is carried out on private property, away from people and buildings, and in accordance with local aviation laws and restrictions to ensure that all flights are safe and legal.I've been flying camera drones since 2014, and in the past year I've been flying FPV quadcopters, which has been both exciting and very challenging.How does the drone perform sensing and avoiding those trees?\u2013 what it offers is the ability to shoot or film what a drone this size can\u2019t get close to, such as people and crowds.If you only take photos, it\u2019ll be just fine; but if your focus is videography, because you have no option to adjust your aperture you'll need to be prepared to change ND filters as often as the light changes, and landing more often than necessary can very quickly become annoying, and negates the usefulness of a 46-minute battery life.As an example, I often shoot videos at sunrise.Having flown the Air 3 in absurdly windy conditions, I can attest to its superior wind resistance power, regardless of how good the Mini 3 Pro really is.This is possibly its greatest advantage over a cheaper sub-250g drone such as the Mini 3 Pro, which itself offers impressive wind resistance for such a small drone.As is now the case with all DJI drones, GPS positioning linked to nearly two dozen satellites enables precise hovering.There's a choice of two controllers: the DJI RC-N2 (which replaces the DJI RC-N1) and the DJI RC 2, an upgrade from the DJI RC that sports two antennas to improve its range and performance.Price-wise, the Air 3 drone with the RC-N2 remote and a battery will cost $1,099 / \u00a3962 / AU$1,699.(Image credit: Future)The 24mm equivalent lens has a fixed aperture of f/1.7, while the 70mm equivalent is an f/2.8 lens.With a fixed aperture, the fast-increasing light levels mean I take off with no ND filter, then five minutes later as the sun rises I have to land to add an ND8, then another 10 minutes later I have to change to ND16.The sensors are the same as on the Mini 3 Pro, so expect similarly good image quality.For many, the Air 3 will be a perfect compromise between the Mini 3 Pro and the Mavic 3 Pro, despite lacking the 'Pro' moniker.You need better wind resistance than the Mini 3 Pro\u00a0\nSpeaking from personal experience the wind can be a real issue in places like the UK.The Air 3's wind-speed resistance is impressive.You use ND filters and want variable lens aperture\nIf you shoot a lot of video, and therefore use ND filters for better-quality footage, a fixed aperture will make your life a lot more difficult, as you'll have to change ND filters as often as the light changes.You only need a single focal length\nIf you really only need one standard wide camera and not a zoom, you may not be able to justify the cost of the Air 3, and the Mini 3 Pro might be sufficient.How I tested the DJI Mavic 3 ProI tested the DJI AIR 3 over the course of a couple of weeks.This classification allows for more freedom in how and where you can fly; refer to the CAA website and our own UK drone laws explainer for more information on drone laws.The Air 3 uses a 4,241mAh battery which is responsible for a third of the drone\u2019s weight at 267g.Both cameras capture 12MP or 48MP photos in raw and/or JPEG, and offer all the standard photography modes, including Single Shot, Burst Shooting, AEB and Timed.A more 'sporty' flight or windy day will increase battery use, therefore shortening your flights.This is a valid question for which there are a couple of simple answers.First of all, it gives you the ability to shoot events where crowds gather.It's illegal to fly over crowds (defined as a group of people unable to disperse quickly in case of an accident), and therefore a zoom lens could offer the ability to capture events (festivals, weddings, and so on) without having to get too close, and without posing a risk.(Image credit: Future)Buy it if...You need a telephoto lens\nBecause the Air 3 is bigger and falls within the C1 category, you're more restricted in terms of where you can fly than you are with the Mini 3 Pro, and a zoom lens allows you to capture footage of events and the like more safely and within legal limits.You might ask who, at this point, \u00a0needs more than that sort of flight time, although with longer batteries come new applications.Image 1 of 8(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)The two controllers available are the DJI RC 2 and DJI RC-N2, both upgrades of their respective predecessors, the DJI RC and the DJI RC-N1.While the 3x zoom may not be obviously useful at first \u2013 after all why not just fly closer?One is a wide-angle 24mm equivalent, and the other is a medium-telephoto 70mm equivalent, essentially offering 3x zoom.Omnidirectional Obstacle Sensing (a first in the Air series) combined with DJI\u2019s Advanced Pilot Assistance System (APAS) 5.0 makes flying in tricky environments worry-free.That's an increase over the Air 2S, which was priced at $999 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,549 with battery and remote when it launched in 2021, but arguably a modest one given that you\u2019re getting lots more features and upgraded remote.Kit options include the Air 3 with the DJI RC-N2 for $1,099 / \u00a3962 / $1,099, the DJI RC-N2 Fly More Combo for $1,349 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,049, and the DJI RC 2 Fly More Bundle for $1,549 / \u00a31,379 / AU$ 2,349.And how well does the signal penetrate through thick vegetation?(Image credit: Future)I tend to fly drones manually, with minimal assistance from either collision sensors or automatic flight features.Although the Air 3 is missing the 'Pro' moniker, its size, features and dual cameras provide a good middle ground for those struggling to make a decision.Without propellers the drone measures folded: 207 x 100.5 x 91.1mm and unfolded: 258.8 x 326 x 105.8mm.Weighing 720g, in the UK the DJI Air 3 is classed as a C1 category drone (up to 900g), meaning it's considered a lower risk to third parties than drones like its heavier brother, the Mavic 3 Pro.The bypass setting offers a 'Nifty' option designed to provide smoother flight when obstacles are detected in more complex environments; however the downside of this smoother setting is a greater risk of collision.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)I tested the Air 3 in thick woodland, and made my way through branches and treetops without collision, greatly helped by the large screen on the RC 2 remote offering a much clearer image than a smartphone.For extra safety the Air 3\u2019s Advanced Return to Home scans up to 200m to calculate the safest route to its take-off point, while AirSense ADS-B provides notifications of nearby planes and helicopters.how does it deal with the contrast between dark shaded areas and bright light-wells, and how well does it perform in these sometimes low-light conditions.I can see it being a useful for landscape photographers, too \u2013 perhaps even to shoot active volcanos without your drone being turned into a lump of melted plastic.Both cameras shoot 12MP or 48MP JPEG and/or raw files on two 1/1.3-inch CMOS sensors, the same sensor used on the DJI Mini 3 Pro.Safety features include Omnidirectional Obstacle Sensing, APAS 5.0 anti-collision, and Advanced Return to Home, all of which, when enabled, combine to make it pretty difficult to crash.Deciding if this is the right drone for you ultimately boils down to your needs as a pilot and as a photographer/filmmaker.As usual, to the untrained ear it may sound like a swarm of bees, but it's in no way screeching, as perhaps the DJI FPV is.As with previous DJI drones, three flight modes are available: Sport mode provides a top speed of 42.5mph with collision avoidance switched off, which is useful if you're chasing a fast-moving subject; Normal mode is slower, with collision avoidance on, while Cine mode provides the slowest flight speed with reduced control sensitivity, for more precise maneuvering and capturing less hectic and more cinematic footage.I fly a multitude of different drones, from tinywhoops to carbon fiber freestyle drones and camera drones, for the variety of creative avenues they offer.What makes it stand out is its dual camera, which is large in size and protrudes from the main body.It can also be useful for photographing or filming wildlife without spooking it by getting too close.The DJI Mavic Pro 3 is too expensive\nThe Mavic 3 Pro offers incredible professional features at a premium, and it's down to you to evaluate your needs and your budget.It's advertised at just under 27mph, and I've flown it in 35mph winds and captured stable footage, although I did get a warning telling me that due to high wind speeds Return to Home may not function as expected.With collision avoidance turned on, the Air 3 can either brake or bypass obstacles when they\u2019re detected.DJI Air 3: release date and priceAvailable from July 25 2023Starts at $1,099 / \u00a3962 / AU$1,699Two controller optionsThe much anticipated DJI Air 3 was available immediately after being announced on July 25 2023.I flew the Air 3 with the DJI RC 2 in thick woodland with far better signal and range than I\u2019d normally experience with the DJI RC.DJI Air 3: Features and flightOmnidirectional collision avoidanceActiveTrack 5.0 subject trackingAdvanced Return to HomeIf you're used to DJI drones, you'll be instantly at home with the DJI Air 3.The DJI RC 2 will retail for $369 / \u00a3323 / AU$549 and a single additional battery will cost $159 / \u00a3129 / AU$359.I fly four different leading brands of drones, and have no affiliation to any of them.First reviewed July 2023Positioned between the Mini 3 Pro and Mavic 3 Pro, it's available either as a standard package (drone and remote) or as the Fly More Combo with additional batteries, a bag, and other accessories.I would always advise starting with a cheaper sub-250g drone like the Mini 3 or Mini 3 Pro, and then deciding whether or not you need to upgrade once you've flown extensively and have become accustomed to the controls, understand drone cameras, and know the regulations.It takes 60 minutes to charge, and provides a very generous 46 minutes of advertised flight time, 48% more than its predecessor, the DJI Air 2S.The DJI RC 2 features external antennas, which vastly improves the poor signal range DJI RC users have reported across many online drone forums.It could therefore be useful to event photographers as a way to shoot safely and \u00a0legally.It flies very well straight out of the box, and if you're concerned about drawing unwanted attention, while it's understandably noisier than the Mini 3 Pro due to its size, the Air 3 does not produce unreasonable noise levels.Wooded areas are a great environment in which to test a drone and its remote.In terms of video both cameras can capture video in 4K up to 100fps, FHD up to 200fps, 2.7K vertical up to 60fps and FHD vertical up to 60fps.Should I buy the DJI Air 3?Fly More combos come with two additional batteries, a carry bag, a charging hub and other useful accessories, and offer value if you see yourself requiring extra batteries anyway.DJI Air 3: Design and controllerIn line with recent foldable DJI designsImposing dual camera720g \u2013 European C1 ratingThe Air 3 sports a look very much in line with other foldable DJI products, in particular previous Mavics with their folding arms.It's a perfectly suitable drone for beginners wanting to push their creative potential, while equally appealing to more professional pilots on a budget.The DJI Air 3 is also a more versatile offering than the DJI Air 2S and a shoo-in for our best drones guide.Video is up to 100fps at 4K with the ability to shoot 2.7K at 60fps in vertical mode, a feature that's very useful if you share videos on social media.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Speaking of the reverse, the board will sit level on a desk, but not flat.MicroPython, C/C++ fans fear not as Robo Pico is merely a breakout board that exposes the GPIO pins.Flashing CircuitPython to our Pico W, we tried out Cytron\u2019s tutorials covering how to use NeoPixels, servos , buzzer and motors.The Pico takes pride of place in the center of the board and around the perimeter we see connections for motors, servos, power and components using both Grove and maker port (Cytron\u2019s parlance for Stemma QT / Qwiic).We don\u2019t need to reference a datasheet or website for the GPIO reference, it is right there on the board.No soldering is required (well you do need to solder the header on your Raspberry Pi Pico, perhaps using one of the best soldering irons.)A few extra lines of code and we had a touch controlled relay clicking on / off.The only differences being the orientation of two Grove connectors and the Maker Pi RP2040 having an onboard RP2040 SoC.Is it code, or is it hardware?It provides all of the features that we need to learn new skills, while providing the reassurance of a well documented pinout and easy-to-use interfaces.Robo Pico benefits from requiring a Pico to be inserted into the board, and that means we can use a Pico or Pico W in our projects.This feature is worth the price alone.Cytron, the Malaysian maker of some of the best Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Pico add-ons is back with another add-on for the Raspberry Pi Pico.The tutorials have been written with CircuitPython in mind and we elected to use that for our tests.We can build quite the robot using all of these components.Making robots is made much simpler thanks to the motor controller and terminals.Every component and connection has a GPIO reference, including extra information for the Grove and Maker ports which is printed on the reverse.This is very handy in a classroom environment.It was all pretty run-of-the-mill CircuitPython on a Pico, no surprises.to build the board, just plug in and go.We see Cytron\u2019s Robo Pico as an \u201celectronics playground\u201d where we can try out different things, without the fear of being hurt (or releasing the magic smoke).Servo connections follow the SVG (Signal, Volage, Ground) pinout that nearly all servos use.There are a number of surface mount soldered components.The MX1515H motor controller is a two channel controller and using the buttons placed either side of it, we can spin both motors in either direction.The $14 Robo Pico is a delightful platform for learning that builds upon previous Cytron boards, namely the Cytron Maker Pi RP2040, to provide a low cost and even lower friction entry point into Raspberry Pi Pico robotics.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The design of Robo Pico is close to Cytron\u2019s other Maker boards, but it closely resembles the Cytron Maker Pi RP2040.We can fit four servos at once, and then connect two DC motors.This is where we noticed that the Maker port and Grove 2 share the same GPIO pins, so we moved the connection to Grove 3.In fact the two are very closely matched.A handy reset button means we can reset and flash the Pico without having to remove the USB cable.Who is Robo Pico For?If you want to secure the board to your project, use the four M3 screw points along with stand offs.Taking it further and we connected up a relay via a Grove connector.The board is densely packed with connections and each of them has a GPIO reference printed on the silkscreen.Normally we are crying out for a module to abstract the complexities of a board, but in this case, CircuitPython handles all of that for us.So let's begin our review of Cytron\u2019s latest board, and learn how much fun we can have for $14.Cytron Robo Pico SpecificationsSwipe to scroll horizontallyRaspberry Pi Pico CompatibilityRaspberry Pi Pico and Raspberry Pi Pico WGPIOFull access to all Pico GPIO pins via headersRow 2 -

A few lines of code later and we had a capacitive touch sensor running.The onboard power switch will obviously turn the power on / off, no matter the source.At a purely hardware level, this is the perfect add-on.Supporting the board is your choice of Pico compatible programming language.",

                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe big idea with the Air 3 is that the quality of the two cameras is the same.On top of those flight modes, DJI has brought the Mavic 3\u2019s Waypoint flight mode over to the Air series for the first time.DJI\u2019s regular D-Log mode, which offers even more dynamic range, is not available on the Air 3, though.The latter makes it great for following fast-moving subjects like mountain bikers and vehicles, but it\u2019s also steady in stiff breezes.Drone range can be a big problem in Europe, because laws significantly reduce transmission power compared to the US.I took it flying in France\u2019s Loire valley with my drone pilot friend to find out.That opens up new possibilities for pilots, giving them two ways to create cinematic shots.As such, it comes with a 1/1.3-inch 24mm (35mm equivalent) f/1.7 main and 70mm f/2.8 telephoto camera.They have nearly the capacity of the Mavic 3 Pro\u2019s batteries, greatly boosting the Air 3\u2019s range to 46 minutes, up from 34 minutes on the Air 2S.It also has numerous improvements over the Air 2 and Air 2S.Design and performance\n\nWith a dual-camera module up front and similar design, the Air 3 (no more Mavic in the name) looks more like the Mavic 3 than the Air 2 and Air 2S.Along with the Air 3, DJI has introduced the new RC-2, DJI\u2019s third screen controller after the RC and the RC Pro.That means the telephoto camera has the same specs as the main camera, rather than being relegated to lesser quality like it was on the Mavic 3.Because the drone flies automatically once you hit \u201cgo,\u201d it\u2019s easy to misjudge boundaries, so it\u2019s good to know it\u2019ll abort if it gets too close to something.All of DJI\u2019s tentpole features like Active Track, Master Shots, Quickshots and Timelapse are available on the Air 3 and work on both cameras.That generally allowed us to fly for a full day with three charged batteries.Steve Dent for Engadget\nQuickshots features like Dronie and Rocket are more interesting with the addition of the tele camera that can add extra intimacy and drama.Image quality might not be good enough for some pros when compared to the $2,200 Mavic 3 Pro, But at $1,100, it\u2019s considerably cheaper, more maneuverable, and offers the same features (including Waypoints) and level of obstacle protection.Otherwise, it matches the Mavic 3 Pro feature for feature, with obstacle detection all around, focus tracking, Hyperlapse and more.Wrap-up\nSteve Dent for Engadget\nDJI has another winner with the Air 3 thanks to the dual cameras.How does it stack up against that model, and how does it fit in with the Mavic 3 Pro and Mini 3 Pro models?The camera module can be tilted down 90 degrees and up 60, and it\u2019s the first Air series drone supporting 2.7K vertical 9:16 video.In terms of maneuverability and speed, the Air 3 offers a good compromise between stability of the Mavic 3 Pro and the agility of the Mini 3 Pro.The Air 3 delivers as good or even better video and photo quality than the larger sensor on the Air 2S, likely because the size difference is slight and the Air 3 has higher resolution.D-Log M offers better dynamic range, particularly in challenging contrasty shooting conditions.At $1,100 with the non-screen RC-N2 controller, the Air 3 is $330 more than the DJI Mini 3 Pro with the same controller.The 70mm lens is particularly good for action or hero shots, adding excitement and a more natural perspective.DJI also announced another new controller, the RC-N2, effectively a refresh of the RC-N1, with the main benefit being the new O4 transmission system.With the launch of the mid-sized Air 3 camera drone, the company has introduced a new trick called dual primary cameras.In any case, it\u2019s a great new option for drone buyers who might like the idea of two primary cameras and can\u2019t quite afford a Mavic 3 Pro.In return, they get additional creative options, plus a more stable and secure camera drone.It also opens up creative possibilities, like doing a Timelapse during the day and at night, then seamlessly blending them together.To help compensate for that, DJI added a new 5.1GHz frequency in Europe that appears to have a large impact on range and transmission dropouts in tricky terrain, from what we saw in our tests in France.DJIDJI Air

\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome buyers might see the 1/1.3-inch sensors as a downgrade compared to the 1-inch sensor on the Air 2S, however.As usual, the main wide camera can be used for establishing, overhead, follow and other shots.At those prices, its main competition is Autel\u2019s similarly priced 6K EVO Lite+ and the Mini 3 Pro itself.It\u2019s a good compromise between the two, as it\u2019s significantly cheaper than the $1,200 RC Pro.It also lets you stay a greater distance from subjects for safety or other reasons, while compressing the space between them.In real-world use, we saw flight times of around 35 minutes before the return-to-home warning went off, depending on flying style and winds.It should prove popular with event and wedding pros who are willing to pay a few hundred dollars more than the Mini 3 Pro.At the same time, it has borrowed some aerodynamic tricks from the Mini 3 Pro, particularly the larger propellers that reduce noise down to 81 decibels \u2014 making it near-inaudible when flying at over 100 feet or so.The body is also more aerodynamic, giving it better range in forward flight and the ability to handle stronger winds than past models.At the same time, if a subject is moving through trees, obstacle avoidance with APAS 5.0 is outstanding, with less risk of crashing than the Mini 3 Pro thanks to the extra sensors \u2014 particularly from the side and rear.Steve Dent for Engadget\nAnother key feature is the next-gen O4 video transmission system that boosts range from 15 to 20 km (9.3 to 12.4 miles).That goes up to $1,550 with the RC 2 Fly More kit, compared to $1,253 for the Mini 3 Pro in a similar kit.It also offers mildly better low-light capability, with less noise in shadows for nighttime cityscapes, for example.The sensors have dual native ISO support for improved light sensitivity, and deliver 4K 60p in HDR or 4K at up to 100 fps with slo-mo only playback.Doing so allows for  longer flights if you\u2019re in a location with no charging available.With the same 1/1.3-inch dual native ISO sensor and resolution as the Mini 3 Pro, image quality is similar \u2014 but there are some improvements on the Air 3.Much of the extra weight comes from the new 4,241 mAh batteries that weigh 267 grams more than an entire Mini 3 Pro.It has the same frog-like design, and folds up exactly like the Mavic 3, collapsing into a compact size for travel.It\u2019s available either separately or in a bundle with the Air 3 Fly More kit.Both cameras support 10-bit 4:2:0 D-Log M and HLG HDR for improved dynamic range and reduced banding, something that can be an issue when shooting skies.It uses DJI\u2019s new O4 transmission system that greatly increases range, while bringing the Waypoint feature to Air drones for the first time.That said, it\u2019ll be interesting to see if DJI releases an Air 3S, possibly with a larger sensor.1080p can be shot at 200 fps with slo-mo playback as well.DJI also introduced a new charging feature with the updated battery hub, letting you transfer power from two weaker batteries to the most charged at the touch of a button.And with identical sensors, it\u2019s easy to match footage from the two cameras while editing.As with DJI\u2019s other drones, it\u2019s generally reliable, but if you\u2019re chasing a mountain biker through the trees, it can lag a bit and the tracking can switch off without warning.DJI is one of the most innovative gadget companies out there, constantly trying new things with its drones like a triple-camera setup on the Mavic 3 Pro.By elevating the tele to the same importance as the main camera, it opens up new cinematic shooting options.The body has omnidirectional sensors all around for obstacle detection.It requires some time to learn and set up, but it delivers consistent results.With a perfect portrait focal length, it\u2019s great for people shots at weddings, for example.At the same time, it has a leg up on the Mini 3 Pro in terms of image quality thanks to the D-Log M option.At the same time, it has a brighter screen, more substantial feel and more precise controls than the RC.Those focal lengths match the two primary cameras on the Mavic 3 Pro, with the sensor size being the same as the Mini 3 Pro and the tele camera on the Mavic 3 Pro.For storage, it comes with the usual microSD storage slot and has 8GB internally that\u2019s really for emergency use only.It also lacks a variable aperture found on the Mavic 3, so the optional ND filter kit (available in the Fly More combo) is desirable for sunny day flying to allow for lower shutter speeds and thus smoother video.It\u2019s also considerably heavier than the Air 2S, tipping the scales at 720 grams compared to 595.It also has much improved battery life and is considerably quieter.The obstacle detection is handy there as well.",

            "paraphrased_content": "It\u2019s still a very capable drone that does many things right but also just a little bit uninspiring.Will 360 cameras make their way here?And no, this drone won\u2019t flip its camera 90 degrees to let you film in true 4K vertically.No?Or maybe we start with a single backward camera?I haven\u2019t noticed any major issues here, like I did with the batteries during my Mini 3 Pro review.Battery life is pretty much the same across the whole lineup now, which is to say it\u2019s about 45 minutes, give or take.Before you get mad at me for this hot take, let\u2019s set the record straight: the Air 3 is a fantastic drone.I do wish DJI gave us both options.DJI also lists a 48MP photo mode, but I have not been able to find it in its usual place in the menu.At its core, the Air 3 is just a recycling of old ideas we\u2019ve already seen in other DJI products.Through a recent software update, DJI quietly replaced D-Log with D-Log M in the Air 2S drone, too.As for photos, this drone takes 12MP photos, and they look good.And it\u2019s called the Air 3, and yes, all the rumors have been true.The usual 24mm drone footage started to get repetitive, so I\u2019m glad we\u2019re getting more variety these days.I\u2019m ready for something new.But don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019d rather pay $1,099 than the $2,199 the Mavic 3 Pro demands, whose third lens, a 7x telephoto zoom, didn\u2019t impress me much.I have reached out to DJI about this.It\u2019s a combination of old ideas we\u2019ve already seen.Could we get built-in ND filters?The ISO of 400 (left) still looks very decent, but photos do lose a lot of detail at maxed out ISO of 6400 (right)\n\nAnd outside of those two lenses, there really isn\u2019t much else to discuss if you\u2019re familiar with DJI\u2019s existing lineup.The Air 3 range is rated for 20km (12 miles), but in practice (and legally), you won\u2019t be able to take advantage of that.Or, even even better, variable aperture?DJI also replaced its D-Log color profile for a less flat variant called D-Log M. It\u2019s easier to color grade, and it doesn\u2019t require filming at high ISO like the D-Log, but it also has noticeably less dynamic range.But the compression in the image alone is worth it, and the parallax effect is great.Here\u2019s a question for you: do any of these changes make you super excited?Between $1,099 (with the new controller) or $1,349 (for the Fly More Combo), it slots in nicely between the Mini and the Mavic 3.Night mode, which was introduced at the end of 2022 for the Mavic 3, found its way to the new Air 3 as well.It\u2019s time, DJI.It\u2019s similar to the camera found in the Mini 3 Pro, which has the same 1/1.3-inch sensor and the same max aperture.But don\u2019t fret \u2014 the image quality is still great.But now it\u2019s up to you to decide if you want a sub 250g drone with proper vertical filming like the Mini, the better image quality from the larger sensor in the Mavic 3, or the versatility of the Air 3.But I do have two minor complaints about the Air 3\u2019s telephoto camera.7Verge ScoreDJI Air 3$1099The GoodVersatile camera Great battery Great low-light performanceThe BadKind of boringHeavier than beforeSmaller main sensor than Air 2S$1099 at Amazon$1099 at DJIHow we rate and review products\n\nThat was my first worry here, and it might be for you, too.What about adjustable aperture trickling down from the Mavic 3 series?The Air 3 can film in 4K 60, and compared to the Air 2S, this drone won\u2019t crop your footage.Both lenses are capable of capturing beautiful airborne images.With a larger f/1.7 aperture lens, the main sensor performs better in low light.It\u2019s a capable flying camera that improves on a few things from its predecessor but makes do with a smaller image sensor than before.The Air 3 is a capable, if uninspiring, drone\n\nAnd that\u2019s the Air 3.There isn\u2019t much new here that would make you incredibly excited to go out and get flying.Or even better, something we\u2019ve all been wanting for oh so long \u2014 built-in ND filters.Let me explain.DJI\u2019s OcuSync connectivity system is upgraded, but I haven\u2019t had major connection issues in years.Don\u2019t expect stunning bokeh here.That means that once I switch from the main lens with f/1.7 aperture to the f/2.8 tele lens, I\u2019ll likely have to raise the ISO, which in turn introduces more noise into my clips.It takes full advantage of either sensor.For one, the footage can look a bit flat.Secondly, as someone who desperately wants to extract the best possible image quality from any of my cameras,\u00a0I aim to film at the lowest ISO possible while maintaining proper shutter speed (double the frame rate).You\u2019ll be happy with what you get here, and DJI\u2019s RAW files leave plenty of information to manipulate in the editing process.The new $1,099 and up drone from DJI has two cameras, 46 minutes of battery life, improved connectivity with Ocusync 4, a brand-new controller, and a brand-new design resembling the recently released Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Pro.I\u2019d love to see something new next year.What I\u2019d love to see are some after-market ND filters that can compensate for that aperture difference and make switching between two lenses seamless.The main lens comes with a larger f/1.7 aperture, while the new 70mm lens has max aperture of f/2.8.Instead, it\u2019s lets you film open gate instead of simply cropping your horizontal footage.Same here.Did DJI sacrifice image quality in favor of some versatility?The Air 3 is eligible for Europe\u2019s C1 drone classification.There is some but not a lot of separation between the foreground and the background.There\u2019s a new controller, and it\u2019s just as good as the last one.PreviousNext1/7PreviousNext1/7\n\nThe second 3x telephoto lens has a smaller f/2.8 aperture, and it is the same telephoto lens that you\u2019ll find in the Mavic 3 Pro that came out recently.The drone world\u2019s worst-kept secret is out.Photography by Vjeran Pavic / The VergeA solid compromise, but I really wish it did flip the camera, though.In fact, almost every feature works on both lenses (including Active Track, Night Mode, 4K 60, and 4K 100fps), except vertical mode, which is to be expected.On the company\u2019s forums, a DJI rep said that it was just a \u201cnaming convention problem,\u201d but it still got a lot of pilots mad.It\u2019s just not practical.One hardware thing you\u2019ll immediately notice is the drone\u2019s audible noise.It lets you increase your ISO up to 12800 from the usual 6400 limit in the normal filming mode.It\u2019s a small complaint, but it does take away from the filming experience.Presumably, it will come later with a firmware update.It\u2019s rated for 81 dB, which is still loud, but due to the propellers\u2019 larger size, they produce a lower frequency, bassier sound, which isn\u2019t as piercing as before.And at this point, I think it\u2019s becoming clear why this drone is a bit underwhelming.Aside from the filming settings, it seems like there is some in-camera noise reduction applied to the footage as well.",
