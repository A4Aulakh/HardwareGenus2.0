            "paraphrased_content": "1.As with Wordle, the answers are the same for every player each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world.Really difficult.What are the Quordle rules?The rules of Quordle are almost identical to those of Wordle.1.8.\u2026BUT the word you guess appears in all quadrants of the puzzle at the same time, so an A could turn green in one square, yellow in another and gray in the final two.But in Quordle, this will almost certainly result in a failure - you simply don't have enough guesses.Plus, it's the only option in Hard mode.There are two key things to remember.You get nine guesses, rather than the six for Wordle, but the rules are otherwise very similar.It's played online via the Quordle website and you can also get to it via the Merriam-Webster site, after the dictionary purchased Quordle last year.6. Letters can appear more than once.You can't guess ABCDE, for instance.10.His Wordle streak recently reached the 500 mark and he'll be inconsolable if he loses it.Quordle is the only one of the many Wordle clones that I'm still playing now, around 18 months after the daily-word-game craze hit the internet, and with good reason: it's good fun, but also difficult.What's more, its makers (now the online dictionary Merriam-Webster) are also keeping it fresh in the form of a new variant called the Daily Sequence, which sees you complete four puzzles consecutively, rather than concurrently.If not, well good luck!None of Q, Z, X or J appear among today's Quordle answers.Quordle today (game #546) - hint #6 - starting letters (1)Do any of today's Quordle puzzles start with the same letter?\u2022 The number of today's Quordle answers starting with the same letter is 0.If you just want to know the answers at this stage, simply scroll down.Use several starting words\nFirstly, you won't want just a single starting word, but almost certainly two or three starting words.That's the case in Wordle too, of course, but it's even more important in Quordle.Between them, these three words use 15 of the 26 letters in the alphabet including all five vowels, Y, and nine of the most common consonants (S, T, R, D, L, P, N, C and H).9.Each guess must be a valid word in Quordle's dictionary.- and there are daily stats including a streak count.Read on for my Quordle hints to game #546 and the answers to the main game and Daily Sequence.In Wordle, you can instead try several of those in succession and hope one is right, assuming you have enough guesses left.The first of these should probably be one of the best Wordle starting words, because the same things that make them work well will apply here too.But after that, you should select another word or possibly two that use up lots more of the most common consonants and that include any remaining vowels.Narrow things down\nSecondly, if you're faced with a word where the answer might easily be one of several options - for instance -ATCH, where it could be MATCH, BATCH, LATCH, CATCH, WATCH, HATCH or PATCH - you'll definitely want to guess a word that would narrow down those options.And rather than complete them in turn, you do so simultaneously.Yes, he takes it all too seriously.2.There are plenty of other options - you might want to get an M, B, F or G in there instead of the H, maybe - but something like that should do the trick.Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green.But Quordle is tough, so if you already find yourself searching for Wordle hints, you'll probably need some for this game too.3. Letters that are not in the answer turn gray\u2026\n4.2. Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow.The website also includes a practice mode - which I definitely recommend using before attempting the game proper!So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green.It's time for your daily dose of Quordle hints, plus the answers for both the main game and the Daily Sequence spin off.7.I'm a Quordle and Wordle fanatic who's been playing since December 2021, so I can definitely help you solve Quordle today and improve your game for tomorrow.For instance, I currently use STARE > DOILY > PUNCH.He's authored dozens of articles on the game for TechRadar and its sister site Tom's Guide, including a detailed analysis of the most common letters in every position.In the scenario above, CLAMP would be a great guess, as it could point the way to four of the seven words in one go.5.You must complete the daily Quordle before midnight in your timezone.What is a good Quordle strategy?Quordle needs to be approached in a different way to Wordle.* Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too).Oh, and it's difficult.Send me an email and let me know.Daily Sequence today (game #546) -

excited about having upscaling techniques from all major GPU vendors in a PC release, that may not be the case here and those are simply there to cover up an unpolished and poorly optimized PC port which is the trend nowadays.This is however something that Gunfire Games may consider adding in the future.It may also explain why the devs didn't bother implementing Lumen as it would have even more taxing on performance.https://t.co/TMASoxW41C\n\u2014 Charlie (@ghost_motley) July 23, 2023\n\nEven the developers themselves put out PC requirements for the game that appear to be relatively low but in reality, you would need a very powerful system to run this game to its max potential.Some people have had limited luck with the following steps\n\nStart the game in Windows 8 Compatibility Mode\n\n\nLoad the game\n\n\nTweak/Lower your Graphics Settings\n\n\nExit, then start the game normally (not in Windows 8 Compatibility)\n\n\nLoad the game (if this works, great!)More recently, developers have been relying heavily on upscaling tech such as NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR & Intel XeSS to fix the utterly bad state of performance of their PC ports.https://t.co/C8ehboMzPN\n\u2014 CapFrameX (@CapFrameX) July 23, 2023\n\n\nA game implementing DLSS, FSR and XeSS is good.via r/remnantgame\nAdditionally, in our PC port impressions, we only managed to get an average of 71.8 FPS with occasional dips down in the mid-30s/40s.I highly recommend *not buying* Remnant 2 on PC as its devs basically admit to using temporal upscaling techs as a crutch to mitigate a complete lack of optimization.Share this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n TwitterRelated StoryUzair GhaniBest USB-C Power Banks For Charging Your Laptop [List]In a technical post in the Remnant Game Subreddit, the devs listed down some general details that include a word on the performance of the game.Go back to Graphics Settings and adjust the settings again.Being transparent, Gunfire Games admits that the game was designed with upscaling in mind.NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR & Intel XeSS A Necessity To Run Remnant II With Optimal Performance On PC\nGunfire Games, Remnant II, is the latest title to feature support for upscaling technologies from all major PC GPU vendors including NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel.We will update this if we come up with any other solutions.But it might also happen with other models.There have been more and more cases this year with the likes of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, The Callisto Protocol, and more.If you encounter this issue, let us know what hardware you're using.Other people have had success just disabling overclocking.This issue occurs in various recent Unreal Engine games with The Hogwarts Legacy, Callisto Protocol, Layers of Fear, and even Atomic Heart.These upscaling technologies are in the game to deliver the smoothest gameplay possible which means that without them, the game might run at a lower than intended framerate.So, if you leave the Upscaling settings as they are (you can hit 'reset defaults' to get them back to normal), you should have the smoothest gameplay.The game utilizes DLSS 2 so without the upscaling technique, running it at the same settings at native resolution will lead to sub-60 FPS which is by no means acceptable given this is the fastest PC GPU we are talking about.You can get the games running on some random instances but most of the time, the error just won't go away and there's no official fix to it by anyone besides some random guesswork\n\n--Out Of Memory when Loading (4090 + others)--\nThis problem seems to pop up more often with 4090s and specifically 13900k Chips.We're definitely going to roll out performance updates after the game's launch.A game relying on DLSS, FSR and XeSS to achieve acceptable performance is not good.pic.twitter.com/cmFplABqQN\n\u2014 Sebastian Castellanos (@Sebasti66855537) July 23, 2023\n\n\nDesigned with upscaling in mind... \nCome on, optimize your games!Our gaming chief, Alession, pointed out that DLSS 3 would have been a better choice for this game.This is something we are still looking into, though in many cases people who get this error are getting it in other games as well.Following is the full statement:\n\nWe've heard from a few folks about the game's overall performance.The game reportedly runs very poorly while not looking that good and not even using any form of ray tracing.The game was tested on a high-end PC equipped with NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4090 GPU and an Intel Core i7-12700KF CPU at 4K resolution with max details.It's also not like you are running a path traced & a massively open-world title such as Cyberpunk 2077.The developers of Remnant II, Gunfire Games, have admitted that the title relies heavily on upscaling tech such as DLSS, FSR & XeSS to achieve optimal performance on PC.There are also some other issues pointed out and most notably, the \"Out of Video Memory\" on the RTX 4090 which is something that I have also been facing on my own RTX 4090 rig.You're free to tweak other settings for better performance \u2013 changes to Shadow Settings will make the biggest difference besides Upscaling.We're here to help sort out any issues you're facing.The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and while the visuals look solid in our PC port impressions, the game doesn't utilize the full Unreal Engine 5 capabilities such as Lumen which is used to enhance the Global Illumination and overall reflections.Still having trouble with the game's performance even after using our recommended settings?",

            "paraphrased_content": "The GPU first appeared in an online database alongside an early sample of the Zen 5 CPUs and now, we can see the actual product.So far, it isn't actually known when the card launches but we can expect the AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE GPUs to launch at a slightly lower price point than the RX 7900 XT which retails at $849 US as its official MSRP nowadays.A $749-$799 US pricing can be expected to tackle the NVIDIA RTX 4070 series but we also can't say if this will be a mass-produced variant or a timed-exclusive design.The company is also rumored to unveil its Radeon RX 7800 XT & RX 7700 XT GPUs around September.The AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE graphics card with 16 GB memory and a cut-down Navi 31 GPU has finally been pictured.Furthermore, the packaging of the card seems to have Chinese labels which point out to a China-only product but whether we get to see it in some form in the global retail channel remains to be seen.The fact that the AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE is a 16 GB graphics card is confirmed by the packaging which reads the specified memory capacity.This could be due to a smaller chip package used for this particular Navi 31 SKU or it could be a compact chip that was leaked out a while ago by Moore's Law is Dead.It is the same Nitro design that we got to see on the other Radeon RX 7900 (XT & XTX) series cards with a custom back-plate and the same dual HDMI and dual DP outputs.Besides that, we can expect some clock and power tweaks.Sapphire's Custom Radeon RX 7900 GRE Nitro Pictured, 16 GB GPU With Cut-Down Navi 31 Chip\nThe AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE graphics card has been in the talks for quite a while.Related StoryMuhammad ZuhairAMD Radeon 700M \u201cRDNA 3\u201d iGPU Driver For Phoenix APUs To Release By End of July\n\nPictures leaked by @wxnod show the Sapphire Nitro variant of the AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE 16 GB graphics card which comes with a massive triple-fan and triple-slot cooler.The card is powered by dual 8-pin connectors and features a BIOS switch, an ARGB header, and a Fan-In connector.Since Infinity Cache is tied to the bus interface within each of the six MCDs, here we can expect 64 MB of IFC which is 26 MB lower than the RX 7900 XT.An interesting detail spotted by @Olrak29_ is that the Sapphire Radeon RX 7900 GRE features a smaller retention bracket and the capacitor area on the flipside of the PCB and underneath the Navi 31 GPU looks to be rather smaller compared to the same model using the 7900 XT design.AMD Radeon RX 7000 RDNA 3 GPU Lineup \"Rumored\":\nGraphics CardAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTXAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTAMD Radeon RX 7900 GREAMD Radeon RX 7800 XTAMD Radeon RX 7700 XTAMD Radeon RX 7600 XTAMD Radeon RX 7600\nGPUNavi 31 XTXNavi 31 XTNavi 31 LE?Navi 31 ?Navi 32 ?Navi 32 ?Navi 33 XL\nProcess Node5nm+6nm5nm+6nm5nm+6nm5nm+6nm5nm+6nm5nm+6nm6nm\nDie Size300mm2 (Only GCD)\n522mm2 (with MCDs)300mm2 (Only GCD)\n522mm2 (with MCDs)300mm2 (Only GCD)\n522mm2 (with MCDs)300mm2 (Only GCD)\n522mm2 (with MCDs)TBDTBD204mm2\nTransistors58 Billion58 Billion58 Billion58 BillionTBDTBD13.3 Billion\nGPU WGPs48424230?24?20?16\nStream Processors6144537653763840?3072?2560?2048\nTMUs/ROPs384 / 192384 / 192384 / 192TBDTBDTBD128 / 32\nGame Clock2.3 GHz2.0 GHzTBDTBDTBDTBD2.2 GHz\nBoost Clock2.5 GHz2.4 GHzTBDTBDTBDTBD2.6 GHz\nFP32 TFLOPs61 TFLOPs52 TFLOPs50 TFLOPsTBDTBDTBD22 TFLOPs\nMemory Size24 GB GDDR620 GB GDDR616 GB GDDR616 GB GDDR6?12 GB GDDR6?8 GB GDDR6?8 GB GDDR6\nInfinity Cache96 MB80 MB64 MB60 MB?48 MB?40 MB?32 MB\nMemory Bus384-bit320-bit256-bit256-bit192-bit128-bit128-bit\nMemory Clock20 Gbps20 Gbps20 Gbps20 Gbps20 Gbps20 Gbps18 Gbps\nBandwidth960 GB/s800 GB/s640 GB/s640 GB/s480 GB/s320 GB/s288  GB/s\nEffective Bandwidth3.5 TB/s3.5 TB/sTBDTBDTBDTBD476.9 GB/s\nTBP355W315W275-300W~255W~225W175W165W\nPCIe InterfacePCIe 4.0 x16PCIe 4.0 x16PCIe 4.0 x16PCIe 4.0 x16PCIe 4.0 x16PCIe 4.0 x16PCIe 4.0 x8\nPrice$999 US$899 US$799 USTBDTBDTBD$269 US\nLaunchDec, 2022Dec, 2022TBDTBDTBDTBDMay, 2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tShare this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n TwitterSapphire Radeon RX 7900 GRE Nitro Graphics Card (Image Credits: Wxnod):\n\n\nSapphire Radeon RX 7900 XT Nitro Graphics Card (Image Credits: @TechpowerUp):\n\nAs for the specifications, the leaker points out that the AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE graphics cards are going to feature 84 RDNA 3 compute units so that means it features the same core config as AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XT but with a slimmed-down memory configuration of 256-bit along with the aforementioned 16 GB memory.",

Facebook\n TwitterThe company did say that it will roll out an update that will disassociate Threads from Instagram.Any false news sharing could spread negative information in the minds of the users.It would be great if the platform introduces a feed directing content from only your followers.Related StoryOmar SohailElon Musk Says That Twitter Will Be Rebranded Soon, Will Be Called \u2018X\u2019 In The Near Future\n\nLacks Key Features\nWhen Threads was first released, Instagram users were quick to jump on the bandwagon.This specific aspect of the app is highly important as the microblogging platform is a source of the latest information and news.For instance, there is no Discover tab as of yet that allows you to explore new accounts that pique your interest.To be fair, Twitter has done a splendid job with its list of features that actually makes sense.Twitter offers a familiar user experience with major features that are not available on Threads at the moment\nTwitter has been in hot waters for a while and currently, Elon Musk is not doing any favors but experimenting with various features.We are very familiar with the mechanics of Threads because we have been using Twitter for a while now.User Credibility\nOn Twitter, you can easily identify if an account is credible or not.The platform has managed to secure more than a hundred million downloads in a very short period.Nonetheless, it is still one of the best microblogging platforms on the internet.Threads have received its first update that brings much-needed improvements but you should still stick to Twitter where it is familiar.You only have the option to search for accounts that are quite cumbersome.For daily updates curated by region or the entire globe, Twitter's Trending list shows what people are talking about and what is the most important update of the day.Mark Zuckerberg copied various aspects of Twitter and incorporated them into the new Threads app.However, the app is still in its early phase and it remains to be seen how it will perform in the long run.On Threads, it is currently very difficult to separate real accounts from fake ones.On a computer, there is not a single way to access information or news through Threads which is why you should keep using Twitter.Below are some of the reasons why you should keep using Twitter instead of Threads.Similarly, Threads has adopted a few features from Twitter which is why you should stick to the latter.For me, Twitter is my go-to source to see news and what is happening around the world when at work.To use Threads, you will need an iPhone or an Android phone.Henceforth, you should stick to Twitter instead of jumping over to Threads just yet.Account Deletion\u00a0\nMeta does give you an option to delete your Threads account but it is tied to your Instagram account.Yes, the platform has a lot to offer, and the fact that your Instagram followers are directly ported to Threads is quite handy.This is one reason why you do not have to make a hard choice when it comes to deleting your account.Currently, Threads look a little barren when it comes to new features and while Meta is working on new features, it will take its sweet time to come close to Twitter.Twitter will eventually run out of its issues and offer a streamlined user experience.Both platforms have a lot of similarities and it is a nuisance at his stage to choose one over the other.For as long as I can remember, Twitter has a web app that allows you to log in through your laptop or desktop browser.These are all the major reasons why you should stick with Twitter instead of Meta's Threads platform.Furthermore, it will also take time for users to hold Threads as a credible source of information.If you are one of them, you might already be familiar with the app.It feels like Meta is holding your Instagram account for ransom to keep using Threads.After the dust is settled, we will give you a few reasons why you should stick to Twitter instead of jumping over to Meta's Threads microblogging platform.For instance, the Stories feature on Instagram was abstracted from Snapchat and it has become one of the main aspects of the app.In contrast, you can delete your Twitter account with your information quite easily.What this means is that it will take for Threads accounts to build credibility.Meta recently announced Threads that took the world by storm.Threads on the Web\nMeta failed to offer a web version of the Threads app.What this means is that if you did not find Threads well and are looking to delete your account, your Instagram account will be deleted as well.Take note that your feed is open to accounts that you have not followed which means that you will be seeing content from everyone that falls into your algorithm.Trending Threads\nAnother important addition that Threads lack is support for Trending topics.This is not the first time that we are seeing Meta blatantly ripping off some of the features and excelling at them.Since Threads is also a microblogging platform, it would make a lot of sense to launch a web version as most people use it for daily news and trends.",

            "paraphrased_content": "We\u2019ve reached out to Netflix for comment.The streaming giant was one of the most high-profile companies to reject Apple\u2019s in-app purchasing (IAP) system despite Apple\u2019s efforts, its iOS and iPad apps don\u2019t support AirPlay, and you can\u2019t subscribe to Netflix via Apple TV channels.The iPad app may be good enough \u2014 we\u2019ll have to see \u2014 after all, if all you want is a big rectangle with Stranger Things floating in front of you, lack of native support shouldn\u2019t be a huge problem?But given Apple\u2019s Vision pro is basically its first TV, it could also be a letdown if running as an iPad app means Netflix is buggy or missing features that other native streaming apps may have.Gurman writes about Netflix\u2019s lack of support in the context of a broader issue Apple could have in getting high-profile developers to develop for its Vision Pro headset, a device that amounts to a wholly new platform for the company.Much more, in fact \u2014 Gurman says he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised if $20 is the new $1 for most\u201d apps on the platform, and that more professional apps could cost between $50 and $250.Neither would his speculation about some games going for $40 to $60, at least at the outset, when buyers of the headset will be mostly the early adopter tech enthusiast crowd.Instead, he says, the company will allow its existing iPad app to run, unmodified, on Apple\u2019s forthcoming mixed reality headset.That\u2019s far from unheard-of on the iOS app store, and wouldn\u2019t be surprising on the Vision Pro at all.Also, we already know Disney Plus will come to the device \u2014 Disney\u2019s streaming service was heavily featured in the WWDC 2023 keynote announcing the Vision Pro \u2014 and Gurman points out that Zoom and Microsoft have both committed software development for it.He also speculates that Vision Pro apps will cost more than their iPhone and iPad counterparts.As he observes, factors contributing to that potential struggle include the headset\u2019s high starting price of $3,500, its likely limited first-year sales numbers, and the fact that third-party apps have already been a problem for Meta, Apple\u2019s main competitor in the space.RelatedNetflix says password-sharing crackdowns caused more signups than cancellationsNetflix just axed its basic ad-free plan in the US and UK\n\nWhen the Vision Pro launches, though, it will start off with a massive library of iPad apps, which the headset can run without alteration.Netflix has chosen the former, though whether pointedly or not, we don\u2019t know.As Gurman\u2019s piece points out, developers who don\u2019t want to build Vision Pro software from the ground up have two choices: let their iPad apps run as is on the device or tweak them for the Vision Pro.Of course, very few companies have actually pledged dedicated software for the Vision Pro at this point, but Netflix\u2019s reticence carries some baggage.Netflix isn\u2019t planning to make a native version of its app for the Vision Pro, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman in today\u2019s Power On newsletter.",

Davis.DC\u2019s Vision Zero program led to resources going to where there was advocacy but not necessarily to the areas that needed the investment the most.Despite decades of focusing our national infrastructure on personal vehicles (often at the direct exclusion and expense of other modes of transport), modern folks gets around on far more than planes, trains and automobiles these days.In the excerpt below, Davis examines the relative successes of Washington DC's Vision Zero road safety program.If you buy something through one of these links, we may earn an affiliate commission.The distinction is important because crashes generally happen all over a community and people walk away from fender benders and sideswipes with minor or no injuries.After the Vision Zero plan was shared, communities were all demanding safer streets.Over the course of a summer, we had ten meetings on street corners around the city, a youth summit with over two hundred young people, two meetings with special advocacy groups, and meetings with over thirty-five city agencies.All streets could be safer, even if incrementally, and without guiding principles for more of an \u201cemergency room\u201d structure.Island Press\nFrom Inclusive Transportation by Veronica O. Davis.In DC\u2019s Vision Zero plan, enforcement was instead targeted to dangerous driving behavior such as excessive speeding, driving under the influence, distracted driving, and reckless driving.Vision Zero is a concept from Sweden that recognizes we are human and we will make mistakes, but our mistakes should not lead to serious injuries or fatalities.All prices are correct at the time of publishing.But the more severe crashes tend to cluster in certain communities.Reevaluating Transportation Policies\n\nPolicies lay the foundation for many decisions.DC\u2019s plan was one of the first in the United States that included extensive outreach during the plan\u2019s development.We did not just inform people; we also engaged with them and used their feedback and stories to shape the plan.However, the plan should have recommended a comprehensive evaluation of all the transportation laws and the removal of any that were not supported by data or did not lead to safer streets.As an example, after talking with a group of young Black teens at the youth summit, we removed all enforcement related to people walking and biking.The task of accommodating these competing priorities ensuring that everybody in town, regardless of physical or financial ability, can get where they're going is growing ever more challenging.The young people conveyed to us that sometimes crossing the street mid-block got them away from a group of people who may want to cause them harm.In addition, we heard from people that having police enforce laws related to walking and biking put the community and law enforcement in conflict with each other.Moreover, this plan offered recommendations and strategies and did not go further.Instead, it argues that the focus should be on deaths and serious injuries.Vision Zero does not demand perfect records, and it recognizes that crashes will occur because we are human.DC\u2019s Vision Zero plan correctly focused on behaviors that lead to deaths and fatalities.Davis deftly agues in favor of a systemic revolution to the transportation planning field demanding better and more functional training for civil engineers, more diverse voices in transportation planning projects, and undoing at least some of the community-dividing harms that America's past love affair with freeways has wrought.Inclusive Transportation: A Manifesto for Divided Communities, by civil engineer Veronica O Davis, highlights the many failings (both procedural and structural) of America's transportation infrastructure and calls on city planners to reexamine how their public works projects actually affect the people they are intended to serve.If you focus on crashes regardless of the resulting injury, you may move resources from communities that need them more because they are where people are dying.The teens weighed their risk of being targeted by violence as higher than their risk of being struck by someone driving a vehicle.That meant the roadway could not be expanded, but we could do a \u201croad diet,\u201d or narrowing of the roadway.The city\u2019s policy decision was \u201cWork with what you have, and if we are going to spend money to reconstruct the road, it will not be to widen it.\u201d\nVision Zero could be a path forward as an overall framework for changing policy priorities, but it needs to be more than a plan, and it needs to be crafted with the people.For example, I worked with a city that had a policy that the curb-to-curb space could not be expanded unless there were extenuating circumstances, and even then the answer was no.If we are discussing data-driven approaches, the laws should target behaviors that lead to crashes that result in deaths and serious injuries.All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.In a world where we are examining policing more closely after George Floyd\u2019s murder, I think plans that reexamine equity in this way should take one more step.Charles T. Brown has documented in his research for his podcast Arrested Mobility how laws such as those prohibiting jaywalking are disproportionately enforced in Black and Brown communities, for men in particular.",

            "paraphrased_content": "(Image credit: Peter Hoffmann)Samsung makes some of the best smartphone cameras with the Galaxy S-line, and its foldables have never quite managed to live up to the same standard.A camera worth the costThe Galaxy Z Flip 4's cameras are its best yet, but far from the best yet.When done well, the benefit to users is huge.It's one part of a smartphone line which has been turning heads thanks to their folding form factors and playful twists on long-forgotten elements of the mobile experience; we've been huge fans.Although the Galaxy Z Flip's compact form factor is part of its charm, that gets away when unfolded.Battery is more than just the milliampere/hour count , and we'll definitely see the power efficiency of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy as well as Samsung\u2019s OneUI optimizations lift the Flip 5, without a doubt.At the same time, Samsung has been overlooking quick charging for its Galaxy line for numerous generations now.As the novelty effect of foldables and their glossy sheen wears off, it is crucial that smartphone makers nail this fundamental, otherwise there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll stick around, at least not in their current guise.At the same time, we've seen rival foldables \u2013\u00a0like the Oppo Find N2 Flip \u2013\u00a0which have well-tuned, competent cameras.Battery life has been a weakness of clamshell foldables, though they\u2019re steadily getting better with the march of time.No smartphone is perfect, however, though it\u2019s certainly one of the best foldables, and there've been some little things we've seen in the Galaxy Z Flip 4 that we're hoping Samsung will address in the expected Z Flip 5.1.It would make it feel more like a regular big phone and not an extra-long big phone.They aren't bad; they just aren't up to snuff for many reasons (mostly reasons of space for hardware).\"We\u2019ve raised the standards for foldable smartphone ergonomics.All the best features in the world mean nothing if you're spending your time plugged into a wall because your mobile phone can't handle being, well\u2026 mobile.If Samsung can\u2019t give us the best battery, hopefully it\u2019s, at least, working on a way to trim down the charging times.Striking the right balance between portability and usability is essential for a device like the Galaxy Z Flip 5, and a shorter, wider form factor is certainly one way to address that.3.Though \u201cthinner and lighter\u201d had become somewhat of a joke in the techsphere \u2013 seeing them perceived as being used as a substitute for true hardware innovation \u2013 being thinner and lighter becomes immensely useful when a smartphone essentially doubles in thickness to preserve its compactness.We\u2019ve already seen something like the Honor Magic V2 impress by being almost as thin as an iPhone 14 Pro when folded, so seeing a more mainstream brand like Samsung achieve the same would be great.Now make it thinner, make it lighterThe Galaxy Z Flip foldables are quite thick when folded in on themselves.(Image credit: Future / Alex Walker-Todd)As technology progresses, manufacturers often find ways to slim down their devices without compromising on performance and durability.(Image credit: Future)Clamshell foldables are big on being paradoxical little things.Samsung's clamshell foldables series is about to see its latest entrant, in the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5.All-day battery life\u00a0Samsung lags (slightly) behind other clamshells currently sold in charging speeds.That\u2019s why we\u2019ve innovated to make our latest foldables slimmer and lighter than our previous generations.\"Make it shorter, make it widerThough it's compact when folded, it is a quite lengthy phone.We\u2019re here for it!\u00a0\u00a04.A thinner and lighter Z Flip 5?Even the form factor of foldables and clamshells makes things like selfies much better, a use-case that marketers have not left unmentioned.Conversely, It would be a little much to hope for a periscope camera on something like this, but if Samsung could shoot for a non-periscope telephoto lens that's reminiscent of the smaller Samsung Galaxy S23, it'd be pleasant; even if it\u2019s main purpose as better portrait shooting.\u00a02.A difference of a millimeter in a device\u2019s thickness may not sound like a big change, but every gram and millimeter in a foldable device requires an engineering breakthrough,\" Samsung\u2019s mobile chief, Dr. TM Roh said, \"It demands craftsmanship with passion.The Flip 4 had some good (though not great) battery life, and hopefully the Flip 5 sees this trend continue upwards.It's still thin enough to play with, but the length goes some way in making it feel a tad unwieldy even compared to something that's a certified Big Phone such as either the iPhone Pro 14 Max or iPhone 14 Plus.A slightly shorter and wider display would enhance the overall viewing experience for multimedia content, gaming, and multitasking.Looking at the Moto Razr 2023 and the Oppo Find N2 Flip, it\u2019s more than feasible for the form factor.It would also make it a little more comfortable to hold and improve the typing experience.(Image credit: Future / Alex Walker-Todd)I've always been one who advocates for the \u201cmost battery\u201d and the fastest charging speeds in a phone.Samsung has already made supportive noises in this direction, releasing the following statement before Unpacked.",

            "paraphrased_content": "(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Installing a game was another step that proved quite variable among the drives.It didn't heat up as much as the TN436 under load, but it doesn't seem to be properly entering a low power state.Again, one of the \"slowest\" drives in our Windows benchmarks ended up as the fastest in this test: The Inland TN436 outpaced its newer sibling.We also timed the initial OS update that's available (as of July 10), and after everything was up to date, we timed the standard boot sequence for SteamOS.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)This is the time required to launch Hollow Knight, after rebooting the Steam Deck.Finally, the top model comes with a 512GB SSD and the premium display, for another $120 on top of the middle tier \u2014 $649 total.We may also revisit this topic with some of the more popular older 2230 drives if companies want to send us review samples.Since the SSD is blank, click the \"Re-image Steam Deck\" icon on the desktop, and after a minute and a couple of button clicks, the Steam Deck will boot to the SteamOS welcome screen.Testing the Steam Deck StorageTested SSDsAddlink S91 2TB\nCorsair MP600 Mini 1TB\nInland TN436 1TB\nInland TN446 1TB\nSabrent Rocket 4 1TB\nSabrent Rocket Q4 2TB\nTeamgroup MP44S 1TBWe'll be including Steam Deck performance results in all our future M.2 2230 SSD reviews, as this is one primary use case for such drives.Prices aren't terrible, but the 1TB drives start at around $100, while the 2TB drives can cost $200 or more.Nearly all other devices would start at around 44\u201351 degrees Celsius and then slowly heat up while running KDiskMark, which is what you'd expect.Plug the newly imaged device into the Deck, hold down the volume down button, press and release the power button, then release the volume button after you hear the power on sound.Download the drive image, then use Rufus USB to create a bootable USB device.We timed the entire restart plus boot process, and all of the SSDs again performed pretty similarly, with the eMMC drive taking about 15 seconds longer.We don't know precisely how much of the cost is related to the display, but it's likely not more than about $25 in raw costs.Some slightly sticky thermal pads hold the metal shield in place, so after you've removed the screws, you'll need to lift the shield carefully.We purchased the base 64GB model during the most recent Steam sale for $330, and promptly set about testing all of the M.2 2230 SSDs we currently have in our possession on the device.It costs $399, and the upgraded 256GB model, with a full PCIe 3.0 x4 interface, tacks on $130 to the price and sells for $529.All of these SSDs are rated for temperatures of up to 80C or 85C, and they're nowhere near that level.We then timed the full SteamOS setup that takes place after you connect to a wireless network \u2014 the longest part of the installation process.Besides that major difference, most of the drives land in a relatively narrow range.The router is capable of 866 Mbps, though you don't see the full bandwidth due to interference.Take out the old SSD, slide off the foil wrap, and then put it around your new SSD.It runs various sequential and random IO workloads, doing the read testing first and then the write testing.The Inland TN446 ended up being the slowest SSD by three seconds, though that's likely due to Linux support for the controller.There are eight small Phillips screws on the bottom of the Deck, and once those are removed, all you need is a thin plastic wedge to pry the system open.We put far more weight on the single-thread results, which correlate better with the actual game load times and OS updates.One of the screws is hidden beneath some metallic tap, so peel that back but keep it because you don't want to potentially interfere with the WiFi reception.The eMMC drive looks very pathetic in these synthetic storage benchmarks, managing just 268 MB/s of read performance and 189 MB/s of write performance with a single thread.Perhaps more importantly, SSDs are damn cheap right now.)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)More useful than the first metrics, this is the standard time required to boot the Steam Deck from a power-off state.Look to these pages for those reviews soon.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)This is by far the most time-consuming task, the initial SteamOS setup.Unlike the re-imaging process, there were no odd stalls on any of the SSDs.Of course, that's using the minimum spec devices that aren't likely to perform as well, but even high-performance PCIe 4.0 x4 drives like the WD Black SN850X 2TB start at just $100.Because we want to compare the performance of the upgraded SSDs with the base model 64GB eMMC drive, that somewhat limits what we can do.There's only a one-second difference between the fastest and slowest SSD, but the eMMC drive takes 7\u20138 seconds longer.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image

Tom's Hardware)KDiskMark is basically a Linux variant of CrystalDiskMark.If you were doing a lot of storage-heavy IO, these results might be more pertinent, but for the Steam Deck, you'll mostly be loading or installing games or occasionally booting the OS.One thing that isn't clear is whether the faster SSDs might be causing some slight interference with the Wi-Fi signal (EMI).First, because we knew the SteamOS installation would hit the storage relatively hard (compared to other tasks), we timed how long it took to re-image SteamOS, plus the subsequent restart and boot to the welcome screen.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Closing ThoughtsGiven how cheap \"normal\" M.2 SSDs are these days, doing an inexpensive storage upgrade for the Steam Deck is an enticing prospect.That's because it uses an older Phison E19T controller, while the TN446 uses the newer Phison E21.For example, installing any game larger than 45GB isn't possible on the eMMC drive.We check that the OS is fully up to date before timing the boot process, so this is what you should normally experience.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)This is probably the biggest difference you'll see (other than capacity) between the base eMMC drive and an upgraded SSD.Still, if an SSD idles at 1W instead of 0.3W, that will reduce battery life.We should see prices drop over time, as several other devices, including the Asus Ally, also use M.2 2230 drives.We will look at testing additional 2230 drives on the Steam Deck as new models become available.That's above pricing for standard SSDs.As with the re-image, several of the drives got to a point where they would stall out at a screen saying, \"Starting Steam Deck update download...\" We waited over ten minutes on one of those drives before giving up, returning to the previous step, and trying again.After you choose a language and connect to a network, there's a lengthy install process for the OS.It's also possible that there's more variation between runs on this step.The random IOPS with a single thread also falls well behind the other SSDs.We ran KDiskMark at least three times, keeping the best results.Note that these figures are more theoretical and likely don't reflect how the storage speed will impact your daily use of the Steam Deck, since most tasks are not purely storage limited.We did not include that additional time, as we figure it will be fixed at some point with future Linux kernel updates.But using the Steam Deck tends to be a far less demanding scenario, plus it's running Linux, so we wanted to run some Deck-specific benchmarks.Any way you slice it, that's a big upcharge for what still amounts to a relatively pathetic amount of storage \u2014 plenty of modern games will happily swallow 50GB or more of your storage, with a growing number passing the 100GB mark.The base model comes with a 64GB eMMC storage drive, which uses an mSATA interface.But M.2 2230 SSDs are a different story.We also measured the first OS update, which took about 35 to 37 seconds on the SSDs, and 44 seconds on the eMMC drive.Once inside, you could replace the paddles and thumbsticks should they wear out.Since game downloads happen over the wireless connection, you're effectively capped at around 30\u201340 MB/s of write performance, which even the eMMC drive can manage.For example, the TN436 performs quite a bit worse than the TN446 in our Windows tests, at least on sustained writes.Boot off the USB device, and in a minute or so, you'll be greeted with the Linux interface.We're testing with the recovery image from July 7 (steamdeck-recovery-4.img.bz2).Depending on the drive, battery life might be slightly diminished, but 2230 SSDs aren't generally high-performance, high-heat devices \u2014 unlike the latest 2280 PCIe 5.0 drives.We have multiple separate reviews for each of these drives that we'll post over the coming week or so.For this test, we were sitting about ten feet from our Wi-Fi 6 capable router, and the Steam Deck reported peak bandwidth use of just 300\u2013320 Mbps.We'll suss out the best and worst of the drives based on the more expansive set of results in the full test suite, as well as their pricing.The eMMC drive uses an M.2 SATA connection.It's surprisingly easy to do the upgrade, but we've got pictures in the above gallery for those that want a brief overview.We're only interested in the storage, so we'll focus on that.Valve's Steam Deck has done more for the world of handheld PC gaming than perhaps any other device in history.Those reviews will have our full suite of Windows SSD performance testing as well, including additional tests with the drives in PCIe 3.0 mode (if they're PCIe 4.0 drives, which applies to all the drives we've tested) because that's the speed of the internal bus on the Steam Deck.If you're reasonably competent, upgrading to a larger 2230 SSD shouldn't be a problem.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Last but not least, we have the SSD drive temperatures, as reported by smartctl.One interesting point the peak temperature doesn't convey is the idle/start temperature.The time required doesn't necessarily correlate directly with the expected SSD speed.For standard PCs, you can pick up 2TB of capacity for under $100.The only reason to get the 512GB model from Valve is for the premium display, which is a steep price to pay if you're just going to replace the provided storage with something more spacious.Upgrading the Steam Deck SSDImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Given the prices, we won't bother with the upgraded Steam Deck models.First, you should shut down the Steam Deck \u2014 you don't want it in sleep mode when you swap out the storage device.Now reverse the process, and you're ready to reinstall SteamOS.One oddity was that several drives \u2014 the Corsair MP600 Mini, Inland TN436, Inland TN446, and Sabrent Rocket 4 \u2014 would stall out for about 60 seconds at one of the \"creating journal\" steps.However, Linux may have better drivers for the E19T right now.All three models of the Steam Deck that Valve sells have similar core features.This step normally just flashes past in a split second, but on those four SSDs, it seemed to get stuck.That's enough for a dozen or more moderately large games, or a whole bunch of smaller and less demanding games \u2014 which are often a great match for the Steam Deck.Note that you'll need a USB Type-C stick or an adapter \u2014 we used a spare Samsung T7 Touch 1TB SSD that we had lying around, but there are far cheaper options like this SanDisk 32GB stick.Steam will also install Proton 7.0 and some other software the first time you install the game, but we didn't include that time in our testing.We uninstalled and reinstalled Hollow Knight multiple times to get a good feel for each SSD, selecting the best result that was regularly attainable.Under normal use, the APU will generate far more heat than the SSD controller, which is what will actually cause the Steam Deck to warm up.We left the battery connected during all of our SSD swaps, though we did take care not to accidentally power up the Deck while working.The interface offers a peak theoretical bandwidth of 6 GT/s (600 MB/s), which is still more than the eMMC drive can manage \u2014 it peaks at around 300 MB/s, as we'll see below.We uninstalled and reinstalled Hollow Knight a few times on each SSD, just to check for consistency of results, which we'll discuss more below.Finally, we ran a synthetic SSD performance test, KDiskMark.An aluminum EMI shield covers the SSD slot, secured by three more Phillips screws.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)After re-imaging, the Steam Deck reboots and eventually loads to the welcome screen, where you're asked to select a language.Some say you should disconnect the battery when swapping out the SSD, but honestly, we skipped that step.A few anomalies during testing warrant mention, as Linux support for the various SSD controllers tends to be a bit variable.As noted, every SSD was in the 44C to 51C range at idle, except for the Inland TN446, which idled at 55C.Still, that's far better than what Valve charges, and anyone who knows how to use a screwdriver shouldn't even consider paying extra for a Valve-certified SSD, not when you can get larger and faster drives for less.We opted for installing Hollow Knight, a 2D platformer that runs nicely on the Deck.Our experience with upgrading the Steam Deck storage was relatively simple and painless.And that's all you need to do to get to the M.2 2230 slot.We suspect the eMMC drive isn't actually reporting the correct data, as its temperature was always listed as 35C.Note that performance at higher queue depths (Q8, or eight threads) tends to be less real-world and more of a theoretical storage benchmark.Reports indicate that the Steam Deck could sell over 3 million units before the end of 2023, and many games have started to add \"Steam Deck\" settings options to make them run better on the low-power hardware.Writing the 10GB or so of OS data to the eMMC takes twice as long as the other SSDs.However, the 2TB drives in the 2230 form factor cost substantially more than the 1TB models, so 1TB is probably the sweet spot for most people.You can see that the original Valve SSD comes with yet another EMI shield around it, and it's secured by one final Phillips screw.Compared to some devices, accessing the Steam Deck internals is simplicity itself.That goes double for the 32-thread random testing.However, you can refer to the drive reviews to see what power use was like under Windows \u2014 they'll be published over the course of this coming week.The Steam Deck only has wireless networking support, and the Steam servers can also experience different loads.That could definitely impact battery life.There are quite a few older PCIe 3.0 2230 drives as well, but as we're just getting started with our 2230 testing, all of the devices we've received for review are newer models with PCIe 4.0 support \u2014 even though the Steam Deck is limited to PCIe 3.0.We're also working on battery life benchmarks, which remain a work in progress.Steam Deck Benchmarks: eMMC vs. Upgrade SSDHere are the results of our initial performance testing of the various SSDs, compared with the base 64GB eMMC drive.We used the default 1GB test size and gathered the sequential and random read/write speeds.We also gathered SSD temperatures while running KDiskMark to see how hot the drives get.Valve cautioned against end-user SSD mods with 2242 SSDs, but plenty of 2230 drives are available and don't require any modifications.The fastest drives are the Team Group MP44S, Sabrent Rocket Q4, and Addlink S91.Valve has a helpful support page detailing how to reinstall SteamOS on the Steam Deck.Unfortunately, we don't have tools to measure the idle power for these SSDs while in the Steam Deck.(It doesn't take as long if you've previously launched the game, even on the eMMC drive, probably due to OS caching.)Our base drive was a Foresee FE2H0M064G-B5X10, though it appears different parts may be used depending on when you purchase the Steam Deck.The only real change is in the storage capacity, as well as the display coating \u2014 the most expensive model comes with an anti-glare screen \u2014 and a few potential extras in the way of Steam profile options.(The Addlink, Corsair, Sabrent Q4, and Teamgroup drives all experienced the same behavior.Besides the OS testing, we wanted to check how long it took to install a game.It still worked with every SSD we tested, but several SSDs with the Phison E21 controller (Corsair, Teamgroup, and Inland TN446) performed a bit worse here.Presumably, it's unpacking files and getting the software ready.",

            "paraphrased_content": "This six-core CPU lacks integrated graphics and carries a recommended price tag of $179.On Sunday, AMD quietly launched its most affordable Zen 4-based processor yet, the Ryzen 5 7500F.Those who want overclockability will probably have to opt for a more expensive Ryzen 5 7600X, which has an MSRP of $299 and is among the\u00a0best processors for gaming.Just like the rest of the Zen 4-based Ryzen 7000-series CPUs released to date, the Ryzen 5 7500F processor has 28 PCIe Gen5 lanes, four of which are used to connect to the chipset, four are meant for a high-performance M.2 SSD with a PCIe 5.0 x4 interface, and 16 are available for graphics cards and other bandwidth-hungry components.Of course, AMD's AM5 platform is more expensive than its time-proven AM4 platform, but the former obviously offers an upgrade path for years.One of the intriguing things about AMD's Ryzen 5 7500F is that the company is launching it in China and some other Asian countries, essentially retaining premium status for its AM5 platform in the rest of the world for at least a few weeks.The CPU features 6MB of L2 cache in total, 32MB of L3 cache, and a dual-channel DDR5 memory subsystem officially supporting DDR5-5200, but which can handle much higher data transfer rates, especially when used with modules supporting AMD's EXPO profiles.Meanwhile, reviews of the new CPU are only published by\u00a0Chinese\u00a0as well as\u00a0South Korean media, and the product is available from China-based\u00a0JD.com\u00a0for \u00a51,239 ($172, $152 without VAT), but not from\u00a0Amazon\u00a0or\u00a0Newegg.Yet, the company's website clearly indicates the availability of the CPU as 'global,' so as we mentioned in our previous coverage, AMD retains the option to release the chip in other locales in the future.Meanwhconsidering mind that iGPUs in Ryzen 7000-series CPUs are designed mostly for office workloads and troubleshooting, gamers will hardly miss this one.Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 Street/MSRPCores / Threads (P+E)Base / Boost Clock (GHz)TDP / PBP / MTPRyzen 5 7600X$249 ($299)6 / 124.7 / 5.3105W / 142WRyzen 5 7600$2296 / 123.8 / 5.165W / 88WRyzen 5 7500F$1796 / 123.7 / 5.065W / 88WAMD's $179 Ryzen 5 7500F will sit below the Ryzen 5 7600 (6C/12T, 3.80 GHz \u2013 5.10 GHz, a basic RDNA 2-based GPU), which costs\u00a0$208\u00a0offering just slightly higher performance in games for $50 more.Speaking of graphics, as the 'F' letter in the model number implies, this CPU lacks an integrated GPU and requires a standalone graphics card.The\u00a0Ryzen 5 7500F\u00a0processor will make AMD's AM5 platform more accessible to gamers with limited budgets who are looking forward to future upgrades.AMD's\u00a0Ryzen 5 7500F\u00a0is a six-core processor with a base clock of 3.70 GHz and a maximum boost clock of up to 5.0 GHz.The processor is rated for a 65W TDP and has a locked multiplier, so it can't be overclocked easily.Meanwhile, the new CPU offers tangibly higher performance than AMD's Ryzen 5 5600 (6C/12T, 3.50 GHz \u2013 4.40 GHz, no iGPU), which can be obtained for\u00a0$116.Just like we reported, the chip debuts in China, but AMD has listed it on its product page for global availability, meaning it could come to other regions over time.",

            "paraphrased_content": "After a nine-hour flight from London, I switched on my phone and was greeted with the usual barrage of notifications.How we get there, however, is still a puzzle that needs to be solved.My dilemma now, at 8:30PM, sitting on an airport runway 300 miles from home, was do I call the HVAC company\u2019s emergency line and send a tech out to my unoccupied home at significant expense (I could let them in, thanks to a smart lock), or deal with it when I get home?I love sleeping in my own bed.I say almost because, thanks to my smart home, I at least had a heads-up about what awaited me.Thankfully, he quickly diagnosed the problem: a fried capacitor.Some proactive solutions are available today but generally require expensive tech and proprietary systems.Access to this type of data could be used by a home monitoring service to be alerted to a possible problem, as long as you\u2019re willing to share.He fixed it in five minutes, to the tune of $300.But this summer, my homecoming was almost a complete disaster.I also checked my bedroom's Mitsubishi mini split heating and cooling unit, connected via a Sensibo Air smart controller.That was only a few degrees cooler than the ambient temperature outside my home in South Carolina, where, according to The Weather Channel app, temps had been hitting the high-90s all week.This type of connectivity-powered service is a persuasive argument for the smart home.The next day, I got a call from a neighbor asking if I knew my door had been open all night.Tapping the alert told me that, \u201cFor the past 4 hours the thermostat has been calling for cool, but the room temperature has increased by 8.6F.\u201d\n\nRelatedEcobee\u2019s new thermostats are its best yetHome, smart home\n\nThe Ecobee app confirmed that both thermostats in my two-zone system were reading between 88 and 91 degrees despite being set to 78.Among them was an alert from the Ecobee SmartThermostat: \u201cProblem with cooling,\u201d it said.This is why I recommend putting a camera in your garage if you plan to open and close the door remotely!)Using a Google Nest floodlight camera near the outside unit, I could hear that the AC condenser was still running, and the Ecobee app also told me that the system was actively trying to cool.Just because your smart garage door controller app says the door just opened doesn\u2019t mean it did.With more connected homes, it\u2019s easy to see how the company could have used that data to fix my problem more quickly, possibly even before it happened, given enough historical data about my system.We can know everything about our homes but can\u2019t do much about it \u2014 at least not from afar.The Climate tab in the Apple Home app showed me at a glance that everything was not alright in my home.But what was wrong?But at least we were prepared for it.A similar thing happened with my Samsung Family Hub smart fridge a few months ago.Photos and screenshots by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The VergeOne thing I\u2019ve learned in my decade-plus of living in a smart home is the importance of verification.Much like our cars have become self-diagnosing computers, so could our homes.The biggest barrier to realizing the smart home's potential is this tension between the convenience we crave and the data and access necessary to make it happen.These include a couple of Apple HomePods (which recently got the ability to measure ambient temperature), an Amazon Echo smart speaker, and some Philips Hue motion sensors.It started on the tarmac at Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson airport.The Ecobee SmartThermostat can monitor your home\u2019s temperature and can send alerts for drops or spikes in temperature as well as problems with heating or cooling.These are temperature readings from the Apple HomePods, Hue motion sensors, and the Ecobee thermostat.This chart, accessible through Ecobee\u2019s web interface, illustrates how the temperature in my home was out of the norm.For example, Moen\u2019s smart water system can shut off your water if it detects a leak or run it at a trickle through a faucet if temperatures are predicted to go below freezing.I\u2019m glad I knew there was a possible boiling bunny scenario in my home, but I want my house to be smart enough to do something about it.A smart thermostat fully integrated with my unit that could identify the capacitor had gone bad, then order the part and send a technician to install it, all before I even landed in Atlanta, is an exciting, entirely plausible concept.While I consider this a smart home success story, it highlights that the connected home\u2019s current state is all notification and no action.This alert warned me something was up with my HVAC system.Using a Google Nest floodlight camera, I checked the outdoor HVAC unit.I opted to wait because I was only a few hours from home.Thankfully the bunny was okay!But it requires a lot of trust.I only partially agree with that theory.The bedroom was a comfortable 78, thanks to the still-working mini split unit.These sensors all confirmed that every room in my house, except my bedroom, was hovering between 86 and 92 degrees.The connected home\u2019s current state is all notification and no action\n\nBefore panicking too much about my slowly boiling home (which currently contained at least one living creature \u2014 my bunny rabbit), I checked the other temperature sensors in my house.And while I would love to have turned up to a cool house at midnight after a full 12 hours of traveling \u2014 with two kids, five suitcases, and a grumpy husband \u2014 rather than the humid mess we had to manage, I\u2019m not sure I want to give up the privacy and data necessary to make that happen.But the system relies on all-Moen hardware, and the smart water shutoff valve starts at around $600.I\u2019m glad I knew there was a possible boiling bunny scenario in my home, but I want my house to be smart enough to do something about it.A really smart home would alert you to a problem, identify it, offer solutions, and \u2014 with your consent \u2014 fix it for you.They say the worst part about a vacation is coming home.Opening the door to 90-plus-degree heat was not a fun homecoming.The HVAC tech told me he\u2019d seen several capacitors go bad just that week, as units struggled to handle the intense, prolonged temperatures.But, frustratingly, it couldn\u2019t offer any more info, and there was no remote troubleshooting option or action I could take.Luckily, this was where the bunny was living, and I checked she was okay with a camera I had set up near her hutch.(I discovered this the hard way when the open/close sensor fell off my garage door one afternoon when I was at a soccer tournament for the weekend.and cuddling my cat, dogs, and bunny slightly compensates for not being in Belgium eating a waffle for breakfast.This alert warned me something was up with my HVAC system.Using a Google Nest floodlight camera, I checked the outdoor HVAC unit.But this potentially smarter solution would involve more direct integration between my thermostat, HVAC system, and the service provider.I called the HVAC company in the morning, and they sent out a tech \u2014 24 sweaty hours later.Thinking it had somehow spontaneously opened, I used the app to close it.Now I had confirmed the problem was my main HVAC unit, which is about nine years old and had been struggling through a week of feels-like temperatures in the low 100s.Of course, this would need human intervention, including physically and digitally allowing the HVAC company access to my home.It alerted me something was wrong with its temperature readings through the SmartThings app, and, after I contacted them, Samsung remotely diagnosed the problem and sent a technician with the correct part to repair it, reducing potentially two expensive visits into one.This could be similar to how a home security monitoring service works today (something Ecobee also does, incidentally).",

            "paraphrased_content": "But while I enjoyed both of those games, I actually don\u2019t think either are ideal summer games for two reasons.If you\u2019re looking for a low-effort, outdoor-playable game, give Ghost Trick a shot.Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is 2023\u2019s perfect summer video game.Capcom\n\nUnlike Ace Attorney, which requires you to look and listen for the tiniest details to thwart your enemies, Ghost Trick is straightforward, which is why I enjoyed it so much as a summer game.In Ghost Trick, you play as a recently departed ghost who must use his newfound powers of matter manipulation to solve his murder by saving the people around him from their own untimely deaths.For starters, in Ghost Trick, you\u2019re not solving other people\u2019s murders but your own.There\u2019s something about Capcom\u2019s visual novel murder mystery games that just make them perfect for the summer.What started as a simplistic \u201cI have lost my memory and I\u2019m dead, I must find out who I am and who killed me\u201d premise turned into a deep story about love and devotion that hit me so hard in the game\u2019s final moments.Capcom\n\nI won\u2019t get into spoilers, but I will say this: remember how that Futurama episode \u201cJurassic Bark\u201d made you feel... yeah.It allowed me to play while I baked my body in the hot Las Vegas sun, blitzed on (way too expensive) drinks by the pool.The lamp will break your heart.The story also takes some too-wild turns in the third act, and it gets a bit unwieldy keeping track of who\u2019s who.Some of Ghost Trick\u2019s puzzles are a little unintuitive, while others require split-second, twitchy timing that I didn\u2019t expect and, at times, found hard to execute given that I was, y\u2019know, out of my mind in Las Vegas.Their hardware requirements force you to play them indoors.Therefore, a perfect summer game must instead:\n\nBe simple\n\nBe portable(Yes, I know you can play Diablo IV on your Steam Deck with a bit of work, but level with me here.)Despite Ghost Trick\u2019s simplicity, I was caught off guard by how sweet the game is and how emotional it made me.Now, you might be wondering how I could call a Switch port of a Nintendo DS game from 2010 \u201cperfect\u201d (the game\u2019s also available on PS4, Xbox One, and Steam) over any of the games actually released this year, like Diablo IV or Final Fantasy XVI.But there were several stunning points where it pierces the veil between game and player that are cleverly done and make for real \u201choly shit\u201d moments.Ghost Trick was directed by Shu Takumi, the same developer who created the Ace Attorney series, which explains why Ghost Trick feels very much like Ace Attorney while also being wildly different in every way.Use your ghost tricks to move objects and cause reactions that can save lives and thwart enemies.You save lives via your ability to rewind time to four minutes before a death and by interacting with common objects, aka the titular \u201cghost tricks.\u201d Thwart an assassin by shining a spotlight in his face or stop a death row inmate\u2019s execution via an elaborate ghost-powered Rube Goldberg machine that has you jump from object to object until you can guide the inmate to safety.Also, you\u2019re not doing the solving in a courtroom but at the scene of the crime.They\u2019re way too involved, requiring a bit too much mental commitment to play.Each life you save (notice I said \u201clife\u201d not \u201cperson,\u201d remember this) brings you that much closer to the truth of your own life and death.",

            "paraphrased_content": "It also has design blueprints from its full-frame cameras that it could migrate to the smaller APS-C format.Perhaps Sony sees APS-C as a novice sensor format, but there are many sports and wildlife photographers in particular who would disagree, and if Sony was to launch an APS-C camera in the mold of the Sony A7R V, then it could become the king of APS-C once more.Sony\u2019s enthusiast APS-C mirrorless cameras should be top of their class.Sony doesn\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel to create a true enthusiast APS-C mirrorless camera for photographers; and I don't think such a camera would adversely impact its full-frame sales.(Image credit: Fujifilm)The Sony A6700 is an improvement over the A6600, and introduced an additional front dial under the shutter button.Focusing is so effective, it\u2019s almost cheating.It\u2019s time for Sony to make a more serious APS-C camera, or at the very least create an optional vertical grip for the A6700 to give more serious photographers the best of both worlds; a travel-friendly form factor that can be expanded for more serious photographic endeavors.Will Sony ever make a serious APS-C camera for photographers?Sony already has the lens ecosystem to support a serious APS-C camera.It may well be one of the best travel cameras thanks to its compact form factor, but most photographers who want A6700-level tech, which includes 26MP stills up to 11fps, also want a camera that feels better in the hand.Don\u2019t get me wrong: the A6700 has a decent handgrip \u2013 it's better than the A6600's \u2013 and it\u2019s also a rugged workhorse.It\u2019s high-end spec with entry-level feel, and it doesn\u2019t have to be like this.A similar form factor to full-frame mirrorless cameras like the Sony A7 IV would suit \u2013 but so would a camera from a couple of Sony\u2019s keenest rivals.The Fujifilm and Canon wayNatural rivals to Sony\u2019s best APS-C mirrorless camera in 2023 are the Canon EOS R7, and both the Fujifilm X-T5 and Fujifilm X-S20 \u2013 the A6700 is something between those two.Their viewfinders are pronounced, on a raised bump in the centre of the camera, rather than squeezed into the top-left, and Sony's Canon and Fujifilm rivals sit better in the hand, too, with controls that are intuitively spread out.Capable as it is, there\u2019s one thing holding it back: its design.(Image credit: Chris Rowlands)Put simply, what Sony fans are asking for is a physically larger APS-C camera with kinder ergonomics, greater customization, and better balance with the kind of lenses they might use: long telephotos for wildlife and so on, of which Sony offers an unrivaled breadth of choice.(Image credit: Future)The EOS R7 and X-T5 are bigger than the A6700, and consequently have more room to breathe.However, it doesn\u2019t have an AF joystick, it\u2019s only got a single UHS-II card slot, and its controls are all-round fiddlier, while its ergonomics are a little awkward, especially with more serious lenses.So, the A6700 is the best mirrorless camera available in 2023 for enthusiast photographers, right?However, its body design still somehow feels entry-level \u2013 and this is a body with a $1,400 / \u00a31,450 / AU$2,500 list price.I won't get drawn into dense comparisons between the cameras; suffice to say that the Canon and Fujifilm models sensibly match their high-performance features for trigger-happy enthusiasts with designs that work in real-world use.Wrong.Both cameras have twin card slots and an AF joystick for making quick AF area selections.Put simply, these feel like proper photographer's tools.After all, they boast some seriously impressive photography features \u2013 take the recent Sony A6700, which utilizes a 759-point AF array and AI-chipset for next-level subject-detection and tracking autofocus.",

            "paraphrased_content": "We\u2019ve seen several companies rise to the challenge and offer their own fast printers.Like PrusaSlicer, Bambu Studio has a tool for coloring prints.Rather, it offers users a set of features they crave: a fully enclosed, easy to use Core XY printer that doesn\u2019t break the bank.The P1S needs a collection bucket for its community-dubbed \u201cpoop chute\u201d which is also in the back.I only had to swap colors once \u2013 when I changed the palette of colors.It\u2019s capable of 500mm/s print speeds with a blazing 20,000 mm/s acceleration speed, making it our favorite speedster and one of the best 3D printers we\u2019ve seen.The action figure was printed using .16mm layers and 3 walls which resulted in buttery smooth layers, taking 2 hours, 43 minutes to print in two batches.Retailing at $699, the P1S is $500 cheaper than the deluxe X1 Carbon, which has more sensors, a better screen and a higher quality camera.Instead of fiddling with complex settings to go high speed, you only have to hit the \u201cturbo\u201d button.Then you push the advance filament button (the arrows and with an E) several times until it comes out of the nozzle.Bambu Lab is at it again, producing a near-perfect printer that impressed us with its speed, quality and ability to handle a vast array of materials.While the P1S hasn\u2019t introduced any tech improvements to the lineup, it has given customers a significant upgrade over the P1P while offering a more affordable choice than the X1 Carbon.Retailing at $699, the P1S is a strong choice for anyone wanting to upgrade their 3D printing experience.The squiggly pile in the waste from color changes.In fact, there\u2019s no option or button to do so, because the P1S handles this setting on its own.Loading Filament on the Bambu Lab P1SFor all its advanced features, loading filament without an AMS unit is tedious at best.The LiDar sensor, camera and touchpad were not made to work with the cheaper printer\u2019s boards.Bambu Lab says its printers can obtain a top speed of 500mm/s and 20,000 mm/s acceleration.These boats have 2 walls, 3 top/bottom layers, 10% infill and use a .25 layer height and .5 layer width.The introduction of the P1S has slashed the stripped down P1P to $599.Fortunately, these are reasonably priced at $9.99 for a stainless steel hotend and $34.99 for the complete assembly.The slicer\u2019s material profile contains a hidden throttle: the Volumetric speed limitation.While reviewing the P1P I documented a single color model of a toy horse I converted into a buckskin, including all the wasted filament.Specifications: Bambu Lab P1SSwipe to scroll horizontallyBuild Volume 256 x 256 x 256 mm (10 x 10 x 10 inches)Material PLA/TPU/ABS/PC (up to 300

Hardware)The Bambu Lab P1S comes with everything you need to get your printer set up, as well as a few extra parts.But I\u2019m most interested in how the printer worked with files I sliced myself.It\u2019s a fairly simple painting program and you don\u2019t need to be a designer to sort it out.The device tab is where you can send files via Wifi, watch video from your camera\u2019s timelapse and remotely tweak the speed and temperature of your printer.To unload or change colors, there is an unload option that handles everything.This system is not as easy as a quick change E3D Revo, and involves several screws, plugs and very delicate thermistor wires.These are also beefy prints, with 7 walls and 6 top/bottom layers.This saves a lot of time compared to running eight batches on single color machine.You can access the speed settings from the slicer or the printer interface.While most things work fine in sport or ludicrous mode, not all materials can melt fast enough to keep up with these speeds.Bambu printers lose some surface quality when pushed to the max, some materials lose their shine and layer adhesion suffers making for weaker prints.The boat on the right was printed at 500mm/s in 18 minutes and the one on the left was printed using the normal speed of 200-300mm/s in 26 minutes.When combined with vibration damping input shaping, the results are exceptionally smooth, high quality prints.Printed in Inland TPU.Edge of 3D\u2019s Top Fuel Dragster Spoiler (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Bottom Line(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Bambu Lab continues to shake up things up with its speedy Core XY printers.Printed with .2mm layers with Polymaker Galaxy ASA using the default settings in 1 hour and 17 minutes.RestoreDoctor\u2019s 50mm Tape Dispenser Cutter (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)I almost gave up on TPU, as it kept getting hung up in the extruder gears during loading.The P1P famously offered \u201cprint it yourself\u201d side panels.The price tag is still high compared to some of our favorite budget 3D printers, but much easier to afford than the esteemed Prusa MK4 or fun to watch FLSun V400.The P1S auto leveling system gives a perfect first layer, which makes working with .08 thick layers easy with the stock .4mm nozzle.It also did not want to print using Bambu Studio\u2019s default settings.There\u2019s also a paper getting started guide and instructions on how to access the slicer and phone app.The web store appears to cover every part, from thermistors to belts, so at least customers are not left wondering if 3rd party parts will fit.You can upgrade a P1P to a P1S but you can not upgrade a P1S to an X1-Carbon.These are by no means perfect \u2013 gray is a brutally unforgiving color for the camera \u2013 but you can see the cooling along the steeply curved front is perfect, and the layers are very neatly stacked on the cabin.Bambu slicer will work with other printers and has a growing list of presets for Voron, Creality, AnkerMake, Anycubic, Elegoo, Prusa, Qidi and Voxelab.A razor blade and screws are included to make a DIY scraper from a file on the microSD.Here\u2019s a couple \u201cspeed Benchy\u201d models, which is the popular 3D Benchy sliced according to the official #speedboatrace contest rules.It supplements the rather annoying rear mounted spool rack, which I quickly replaced with a table-top spool holder to sit in a more accessible spot next to the printer.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)When the P1S does have an error \u2013 even the best printers can choke \u2013 it tries to help you diagnose the problem by issuing an error code.(Image credit: Bambu Lab P1S)There\u2019s also a \u201cbackup\u201d option for the AMS which will allow it to automatically switch from one slot to the next instead of tripping a run out sensor.This number is the volume of filament that can be extruded per second.It\u2019s the 3rd Core XY printer brought to us by Bambu Lab \u2013 all three share the same motion system, build volume, speed and quality.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The AMS has pockets for descant and seals tightly, allowing you to use the AMS as a drybox for temperamental filament like Nylon.However, that\u2019s twice the default speed of the printer.You only need to attach the spool holder and control screen.Once the print was slowed down to 75mm/s on the walls the prints came out perfectly strong.The results are super smooth.Chris Pirillo\u2018s Yoda Baby for Me (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)You don\u2019t need to make multicolor prints to appreciate the usefulness of the Bambu Lab AMS as \u00a0a handy spool holder.These are gears for a new RC controlled \u201cDeath Racer\u201d car we\u2019ll be competing with at the East Coast RepRap Festival.Shockingly, the P1S doesn\u2019t bring any technological improvements to the table.Once I slowed the speed down to 40mm/s second I got a perfectly smooth clean print.The print head stays at the top of the machine while the build plate slowly lowers.There is no way or even need to adjust the z height.The units cost $349 each and can be placed on top or next to the printer.To appease any sense of buyer\u2019s remorse, Bambu Lab is offering a P1P to P1S upgrade kit for $150.This is where I also learned that nylon looks great when printed at high speed, but suffers from weak layer adhesion.It\u2019s also eight hours faster \u2013 and less wasteful \u2013 than if I ran all the parts using four colors at once with swaps and purges.You can read more about the AMS in that review.Bugman140\u2019s Clyde, printed in three colors.This file can include several plates of build parts, photos and a bill of materials.Printing on the Bambu Lab P1SOur P1S review unit came with a partially filled spool of green Bambu Lab PLA.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The printer also came with several pre-sliced files to print.This is great to get you started, but you\u2019ll want to check out our guide to the best filaments for 3D printing for more suggestions.Unfortunately, that means this RC race car spoiler took a very leisurely 5 hours and 47 minutes to print using .2mm layers and 4 walls.The control screen is a confusing mess of cryptic symbols.The P1S has one of the best auto bed leveling systems, input shaping, a PEI coated flex plate, linear rods and a self-cleaning tool head.This has not changed.It\u2019s also a no-brainer for creative makers who want colorful prints without the need for paint.There\u2019s some interesting fuzziness along the shaft, but I\u2019m not sure what was the cause.The P1S is a less expensive version of the very popular X1 Carbon, a deluxe 3D printer that introduced the masses to effortless Core XY speed in 2022.This Baby Yoda painting took 2 hours and 36 minutes to print using Polymaker LM Sparkle Green and Christmas Green PLA Pro, Bambu Lab Green PLA, and 3D Fuel Lulzbot Green PLA+.Once a print is sent, you have the option of bumping it up from standard to \u201csport\u201d or \u201cludicrous\u201d speed, which is 124% and 164% faster than normal.These tags tell the printer what type and color of material you have installed, and then matches it with presets in Bambu Studio.But the error code will also appear on the phone app and the device tab on your computer.These codes are links to the Bambu Wiki, a knowledge base for operating any Bambu printer.The printer\u2019s highly sensitive auto bed leveling system makes for a perfect first layer.If you use 3rd party filament, you\u2019ll have to fill that information in by hand.The Bambu Lab Studio is all you need to digitally paint your models with color.The AMS also lets me \u201cpaint\u201d with four colors without manual color changes.You only push filament 2 cm into the feeder and it automatically slurps it into the system.Preparing Files / Software for Bambu Lab P1S(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Bambu Studio is the custom slicer for the P1S and its fellow 3D printers.If you\u2019re just starting out and want to keep things budget friendly, we still wholeheartedly recommend the hassle-free Neptune 3 Pro which has all the features you need for just $230.MORE: Best 3D PrintersMORE: Best Budget 3D PrintingMORE: Best Resin 3D PrintersThe fit was tight, but the parts are so sturdy I was able to bang them together with a hammer.There is no need to set the z height or z offset.First heat up the hotend (click the down arrow with waves) then load the filament through the reverse Bowden tube until it stops at the hot end.It is fully enclosed with plastic sides \u2013 rather than aluminum \u2013 and shares the same D-pad selector interface as the P1P.The Wiki will help you identify and fix the problem, often with quick video tutorials.Bambu Lab Automatic Material System (AMS)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)One of the major advantages of the P1S is its compatibility with Bambu Lab\u2019s AMS system \u2013 a four spool feeder that unlocks the ability to print in four, eight, twelve and even sixteen colors.This action figure was made using eight colors, with each part printed individually on shared plates.This means a \u201cludicrous\u201d TPU print is a lot slower than a \u201cludicrous\u201d PLA print.To use this setting, you\u2019ll need to have identical spools loaded.Assembling the Bambu Lab P1SThe Bambu Lab P1S comes mostly assembled and only needs to be unpacked.There\u2019s also a sample of green PLA on a full sized, reloadable spool.The microSD card contains several test models.This includes plastic panels, a glass door and top cover plate, heavy-duty toolhead cable and chain, and cabin fans.I printed a slide style chute that brings filament waste to the side of the machine.TheLightSpd\u2019s Purge Slide (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The P1S comes equipped with an all-metal hotend and long-lasting .4mm stainless steel nozzle.We\u2019re also certain that all that violent movement can\u2019t be good for the printer\u2019s longevity.If you want the option of switching between nozzle sizes, it\u2019s advisable to purchase complete hotend assemblies.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Since the P1S is enclosed, I had to try some practical prints with engineering grade materials.This takes about 6 minutes, but you\u2019re free to uncheck the option if you don\u2019t want to take the time.If you don\u2019t need to print engineering grade materials, the open frame P1P has the same quality and speed for $599.When I took this screenshot, the symbol was orange, warning me it\u2019s time to switch.These prints are using Bambu green PLA, Inland Blue, Black, White and Light Brown PLAs, Polymaker Starlight Jupiter (hair), and Protopasta Double Espresso (pants).PlayAction\u2019s Kay Vess figure with a McGybeer Cali-Dragon.Fortunately, there are easy to use presets for all types of filament that work very well.The AMS unit is able to read RFID ID tags the company installs on each roll of its own filament for easy identification.You should also check out Creality\u2019s K1, a slightly faster Core XY enclosed printer for $599.All the printer\u2019s parts are custom and need to be purchased directly from Bambu Lab.It\u2019s largely based off of \u00a0PrusaSlicer and should feel very familiar to Prusa fans, though as a Cura user myself there was a bit of a learning curve.I only used a bit of glue stick on the PEI plate and the gears suffered no lifting or warping.Death Racer Gears (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)It had no problems with recycled PETG, which seems to work better than new PETG on high speed printers.This Greengate Amethyst printed using the default settings and a .2mm layer height in 1 hour and 52 minutes with smooth layers and just the tiniest wisps.Humebeam\u2019s Dragon Phone Holder (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)I also tested ASA with this handy tape dispenser.I need these parts to be strong and unbreakable, so I picked Matterhacker\u2019s Pro Nylon.This part printed smooth and without any warping, using just a bit of glue stick.The calibration dragon took 23 minutes to print using .2mm layers and 3 walls.Both models are printed in ordinary Inland Grey PLA .Creative Tool\u2019s 3D Benchy (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The printer was able to tackle \u201cfilament painting\u201d with HueForge without having to switch to a super fine nozzle.The code will appear on the printer\u2019s screen as a long scroll of unhelpful numbers.You can also save complex builds in the project manager, which will then create a single 3mf file you can share.Once you\u2019re up and running the machine will automatically run a bed leveling check before each print.Core XY printers use a combination of belts to move the X and Y axis in tandem for smoother, faster printing.Its simple set up and ease of use makes it an excellent first printer for people with a bigger than Ender sized budget.One tall gear took 1 hour and 13 minutes to print.Even if you don\u2019t use multicolor, the machine will purge filament into a waste chute before every print.The printed guide walks you through each step.Leveling the Bambu Lab P1S(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The Bambu Lab P1S has an excellent auto leveling system combined with vibration compensation, pressure advance and semi-automatic belt tensioning.The box has a QR code printed on the inside flap that leads to an unpacking video.Design of the Bambu Lab P1S(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The P1S is the budget model of Bambu Lab\u2019s deluxe X1-Carbon 3D printer.The optional AMS is $349 dollars and perches on the printer\u2019s glass top.An indicator on the Device tab of Bambu Studios lets you know when it's time to dry out your descant packets.After a few minutes of auto calibration the printer just works.The P1S is compatible with Bambu Lab\u2019s now-famous, four-color Automatic Material System.A thorough self test is run after unpacking the machine to make sure everything is in working order.This could be handy for using up partial spools or prints that will need more than one spool.You get tools to maintain the printer, a spare hotend, two spare nozzle wiping pads, and a microSD card.If you opt for an AMS unit, filament loading and unloading is handled by the machine.Input shaping is really doing it\u2019s job on these prints, as there is no noticeable difference between the two.The nozzle itself is not replaceable \u2013 you need to swap out the entire hotend if it gets worn down.Why not run ludicrous all the time?This horse is printed in 3D Fuel\u2019s Buzzed, Protopasta Empire Strikes Black and Bambu Lab White PLA.",

Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow.The first of these should probably be one of the best Wordle starting words, because the same things that make them work well will apply here too.Plus, it's the only option in Hard mode.\u2026BUT the word you guess appears in all quadrants of the puzzle at the same time, so an A could turn green in one square, yellow in another and gray in the final two.There are two key things to remember.You have nine guesses to find the Quordle answers.It's time for your daily dose of Quordle hints, plus the answers for both the main game and the Daily Sequence spin off.As with Wordle, the answers are the same for every player each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world.That's the case in Wordle too, of course, but it's even more important in Quordle.3. Letters that are not in the answer turn gray\u2026\n4.And also as with Wordle, the puzzle resets at midnight so you have a fresh challenge each day.But Quordle is tough, so if you already find yourself searching for Wordle hints, you'll probably need some for this game too.With four puzzles to solve in nine guesses, you can't blindly throw letters at it and expect to win - you'll stand a far better chance if you think strategically.10.8.In the scenario above, CLAMP would be a great guess, as it could point the way to four of the seven words in one go.You get nine guesses, rather than the six for Wordle, but the rules are otherwise very similar.6. Letters can appear more than once.So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green.And rather than complete them in turn, you do so simultaneously.None of Q, Z, X or J appear among today's Quordle answers.Quordle today (game #545) -

you simply don't have enough guesses.It's played online via the Quordle website and you can also get to it via the Merriam-Webster site, after the dictionary purchased Quordle last year.If not, well good luck!For instance, I currently use STARE > DOILY > PUNCH.You do not have to include correct letters in subsequent guesses and there is no equivalent of Wordle's Hard mode.It's risky, but will sometimes work.Send me an email and let me know.Daily Sequence today (game #545) -

you might want to get an M, B, F or G in there instead of the H, maybe - but something like that should do the trick.Quordle today (game #545) - hint #2 - total vowelsWhat is the total number of vowels in Quordle today?\u2022 The total number of vowels across today's Quordle answers is 5.Quordle today (game #545) -

            "paraphrased_content": "Even when it\u2019s supremely goofy, it all feels like Strange New Worlds, not like a weird and forced crossover.Jack Quaid and Tawny Newsome move seamlessly between the two mediums, and much of their outrageousness is easily explained away because, you know, they\u2019re from the future.That took me by surprise when I tuned in.I\u2019d been tentatively excited about this episode since they announced it last year at SDCC.Also, it turns out that when you put a bunch of really good and really committed actors on a sound stage together, they can work some magic.This has meant studios need to rely on something besides the labor of actors to promote their shows, and Paramount Plus settled on this surprise drop.There might not be any actors or big casting announcements at San Diego Comic-Con this year, but Paramount Plus did find one way to surprise fans.With episode 7 now airing today, the rest of the rest of the season will be airing a little earlier than expected.Things are just weirder in the future.The characters of Strange New Worlds struggle to match the energy of the Lower Decks characters, but the actors playing them develop an easy rhythm that really helps bridge the two very different shows well.Strange New Worlds episode 8 will air this Thursday, July 27th.There aren\u2019t as many star-studded panels and zero major casting announcements.Having already seen this episode, I can confirm this is all exactly as delightful as it sounds.The other is a frequently raunchy comedy about the people who keep the ship running while the heroes are out heroing.Episode 7, \u201cThose Old Scientists,\u201d is available right now and manages to bring the characters of Lower Decks, a very frenetic animated show, into the more traditional Star Trek world of Strange New Worlds remarkably well.It\u2019s dropping the next episode of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds five days early.I was curious how they\u2019d pull it off.Meshing those two tones together could have been disastrous, but Strange New Worlds has always been good at hopping from genre to genre and tackling bit tonal shifts with aplomb.Episode 9, the musical episode, will air the Thursday after that, and episode 10, the season finale, will air on August 10th.One show is about a group of extraordinary heroes who travel the stars and save the universe.With the actors on strike, SDCC has been much more muted than in previous years.The episode also happens to be the very anticipated crossover episode featuring the live-action version of some of the cast of Star Trek: Lower Decks.",

            "paraphrased_content": "For instance, he\u2019s mightily disturbed by the fact that Spock \u2013 happy in a relationship with Chapel \u2013 is laughing, smiling and generally acting like he\u2019s in love.Following an early screening at Comic-Con, the episode is now available to watch on Paramount Plus.Except, the hardware had power enough for just one trip, and there\u2019s not a fuel source available anywhere else in the quadrant.Depending on who you ask, the sketch was either taken in the spirit it was intended, or with outrage amongst fans who felt mischaracterized, and misunderstood.Boimler urges Pike to be diplomatic, but winds up forcing him to trade a supply of much-needed triticale grain to get it back.At the same time, the Enterprise has to deal with an Orion vessel with undetermined intentions which then steals the time portal.On the Enterprise, Boimler can\u2019t help but express his shock, surprise and generally fanboy out in front of his heroes.Boimler brags it was found by Starfleet, but Tendi says it was Orion scientists, once again trying to dispel myths that all Orions are pirates.Pike sees this \u2013 and the forced relocation of a planet-full of starving colonists \u2013 as preferable to having this guy on his ship any longer.At the very least, with Strange New Worlds and Lower Decks in production at the same time, it\u2019s a great time to be a Star Trek fan.The fact it exists at all is a joy, even if it\u2019s not as wonderful as it could have been, and I\u2019d love nothing more than to see more forays into the real world by the Lower Decks crew.(But not before the Strange New Worlds crew can reveal that they, too, are secretly as nerdy as a bunch of fans of their predecessors from Enterprise as Boimler is for this era.)Plenty of the elements, including the animated title sequence, reached straight into the lizard part of my brain and left me grinning like a loon.And with that, we\u2019re into an animated version of the title sequence, complete with nacelle-sucking alien.In the moment where Boimler and Mariner try to solve things on their own, they\u2019re instantly shut down by La\u2019an and Uhura and told to sit back on the bench.The screenplay, credited to Lower Decks\u2019 executive story editor Kathryn Lyn and Bill Wolkloff, is crammed full of great gags.Boimler and Mariner wind up spending some time with their heroes, until they eventually realize that the Enterprise itself has a supply of fuel.They meet with the Orions again, and Pike pledges to claim that the Orions discovered the portal, giving their burgeoning science ship a small chunk of credit.When he arrives on the other side, he\u2019s now in the live action world of Strange New Worlds, and is greeted by Spock, Una and La\u2019an.Ever since Strange New Worlds\u2019 second season was announced, the big draw has been the crossover episode with animated sitcom Lower Decks.It would see Tawny Newsome (Mariner) and Jack Quaid (Boimler) taking their until-now animated characters into live action.The worst served by this is Tawny Newsome, who is absent a major chunk of the episode and has little to do when Mariner does finally arrive in the past.The following article contains spoilers for \u201cThose Old Scientists.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an SNL sketch where William Shatner, as himself, exhorts a room full of Star Trek fans to \u201cGet a Life!\u201d It\u2019s clearly intended in jest, given Shatner\u2019s barely-suppressed smile and a twist where Phil Hartman\u2019s manager forces him to instantly recant his rant.After all, the Spock he knows \u2013 his Spock \u2013 isn\u2019t this outwardly emotional, because that\u2019s what the legend tells us.When the portal is active and back in position, the Enterprise crew ready to get rid of this purple-haired irritation, Mariner leaps through, bravely declaring that she\u2019s coming to the rescue.But it\u2019s this dichotomy, between the legend and the truth that\u2019s mined for laughs in \u201cThose Old Scientists,\u201d the crossover episode between Strange New Worlds and Lower Decks.But, since this is the Boimler we know and love, he can\u2019t help but throw spoilers out left, right and center.We get a lot of scenes of Boimler and then Mariner telling the Enterprise crew how great they are, or are seen as such, by their successors.That cotton candy metaphor is probably the best way to sum up \u201cThose Old Scientists,\u201d a goofy snack between meatier meals, or episodes, either side.Well, that and an affectionate elbow in the ribs suggesting that we could all do with being a bit less obsessive.I know that this is Strange New Worlds, and so the narrative will always belong with this crew rather than its guest stars.But, and there is a but, the episode is a bit like cotton candy in that once the initial hit of sugar leaves your tongue, there\u2019s little else here.Leaving an eye-rolling Pike with the unwelcome possibility that they\u2019re stuck with the Cerritos\u2019 pair for good.It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s a stand-in for the sort of obsessive fan who tries to police the borders of what Star Trek is, instead of enjoying the journey.Most of these scenes take place sitting around desks, bars or lounges \u2013 telling rather than showing.The (animated) beta shift is making a routine survey of a long-dormant time-travel portal, while Boimler and Tendi argue about who discovered it.It helps, too, that Strange New Worlds has enough comic talent in its ranks to play an episode like this, and Carol Kane steals the show with the best gag in the episode.And when Boimler and Mariner leap back to the future, the Enterprise crew drink an Orion cocktail that, in the closer, renders them all as animated characters.He gets lectured by La\u2019an about not polluting the timeline and, thanks to her adventure in \u201cTomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow,\u201d not getting attached.While messing around Boimler is standing on the portal when Rutherford accidentally sets it running, throwing him back in time.But the lower deckers are rendered passive observers in a narrative that could, or should, really have enabled them to demonstrate the dynamism they have in their own show.\u201cThose Old Scientists\u201d is as pure a dose of fan service as Star Trek has ever produced, and I mean that as both a compliment and a criticism.Thanks to the naval tradition of using a component from the previous vessel in the construction of the next one, they can refine a chunk of NX-01 into fuel which can be used to send the pair home.Not to mention his insistence on pointing out the difference between the history as he knows it, and the storylines as they\u2019re presently unfolding on Strange New Worlds.",

            "paraphrased_content": "(Image credit: YouTube - Digital Foundry)In further testing with Gen 3 NVMe SSDs, the review outlet found that RTX IO was able to boost load time performance by an additional 90ms beyond what the SATA 3 drive was able to achieve.Digital Foundry recently took a sneak peek at Nvidia's new RTX IO GPU decompression technology in Portal: Prelude RTX, and found the tech can seriously improve game load times with modern SSD hardware.With RTX IO disabled (featuring a specialized test build of the game), the game was able to load in 2.36 seconds.It also improves the capabilities of any storage drive, whether or not you have the Best SSDs in your system.This is just a glimpse of the capabilities can expect from RTX IO GPU decompression.All you need is a GPU that supports DirectStorage or Nvidia's new Vulkan extensions to run it.In testing, Digital Foundry found that RTX IO was able to improve load time performance by roughly 50% in Portal: Prelude RTX.Portal: Prelude RTX is a mod of a mod based on a game created 15 years ago, so there's no real-world benefit from having RTX IO unless you really crave sub-3-second load times.Additionally, RTX IO was also able to turbocharge the SATA 3 drive, making the slower SSD faster than the NVMe drive with RTX IO enabled (and RTX IO disabled on the NVMe drive).Sub-three-second loading times are plenty fast for any video game, but from a benchmarking perspective.Instead of transferring data to the CPU for decompression, RTX IO's GPU decompression transfers all game assets from storage to the GPU, where the GPU cores decompress the data at a significantly faster pace.RTX IO is a term that Nvidia coined to comprise several technologies for GPU-based loading and asset decompression.Cutting an extra second off of the load time is very impressive and a good demonstration of RTX IO's capabilities.As a result, you don't need an Nvidia GPU to run RTX IO necessarily.The game review outlet found that Nvidia's new storage-enhancing tech cut loading times in half, drastically accelerating the wait time for both game levels and high-resolution textures found in the game.RTX IO is a new method of uploading game information to your graphics card, that reduces game loading times and decreases CPU utilization.In actuality, RTX IO is based on GDeflate, an open-source compression format Nvidia created that is supported by Microsoft's DirectStorage API, and Vulkan \u2014 with two new Nvidia Vulkan extensions.Rachet and Clank: Rift Apart will be the first game to truly test RTX IO when it arrives next week, and will hopefully show substantially more tangible results with RTX IO, with its inter-dimensional gameplay demanding instantaneous asset streaming.But by turning RTX IO on, the game was able to load everything in just 1.16 seconds \u2014 including the test chamber and the high-resolution textures.Testing was conducted on a Core i9-12900K and an RTX 4090, with the game stored on a 500MB/s SATA 3 SSD.",

            "paraphrased_content": "At the end of the film, Oppenheimer finally comes to understand something many of his colleagues have been saying from the beginning.And the movie would have benefitted from more insight into Oppenheimer's thinking.Universal Pictures\nDunkirk was a purely cinematic, almost dialog-free depiction of a famous wartime evacuation.He mingles with notable scientists, including Albert Einstein himself, and makes a name for himself as a quantum physics researcher.The film is strongest when it focuses on the specificities of the Manhattan Project: the rush to build a bomb before Nazi Germany, the pushback from scientists terrified about the damage \"the gadget\" could do.Only he can put the right scientists together and motivate them to work; only he can solve the riddles of quantum physics to keep America safe.We see him confront President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman) in a vain attempt to stop building nuclear weapons, and the film points to his very public stance against future bombs.The film, which is based on the biography American Prometheus by Martin J. Sherwin and Kai Bird, follows Oppenheimer from his time in Germany as a doctoral student, to his professorship at UC Berkeley.Nothing will be the same because of him.And Tenet was a bold attempt at mixing another heady sci-fi concept (what if you could go backwards through time?!)Oppenheimer, meanwhile, is a mostly talky film set in a variety of meeting rooms, save for one explosive sequence.There is no peace now, only the undying specter of nuclear annihilation.Interstellar was ostensibly a story about a man exploring the cosmos to find a new planet for humanity, but it also wrestled with personal sacrifices as his children aged beyond him.Oppenheimer may seem like a curious project for Nolan: Since wrapping up his Batman trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises, he's thrown himself into increasingly complex projects (perhaps to atone for that disappointment).Save for one virtuoso set piece \u2014 the build-up and aftermath of a successful atomic bomb test is Nolan at his best \u2014 what's most impressive is how cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema makes those conversations utterly engaging.We've never seen Cillian Murphy's piercing blue eyes do so much work in close-up.Some colleagues criticize his cavalier attitude about building an atomic bomb \u2014 they think it can lead to untold disaster, while he naively thinks it may be so powerful it could end all war.Universal Pictures\nThe movie firmly focuses on Oppenheimer's point of view, so much so that we mainly see him as a heroic tortured genius.It's a surprisingly standard biopic, even though it's three hours long and far more technical than any studio film this year.It's also a way for J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) to ground himself as he wrestles with the major conflict around his work: Building an atomic bomb could help win the war, but at what cost to humanity?It's a look that serves as a sort of armor against mere mortals, who he woos with a peculiar charisma, as well as the military and political bureaucracy he battles while leading the Manhattan Project.But, for the most part, we're left feeling that he was a great man who was ultimately betrayed by a country that didn't care for his post-war anti-nuclear activism.We see Oppenheimer as more than just a bookish geek: He sends money to anti-fascists fighting in the Spanish Civil War, he pushes for unionization among lab workers and professors, and he supports local Communists.It's not too long before he's recruited to the Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb, and the myth-making truly begins.I wasn't able to see Oppenheimer on an IMAX screen, unfortunately, but sitting front row in a local theater still managed to be a thoroughly immersive experience.with bombastic James Bond-esque set pieces.At the very least, it would have been interesting to see Oppenheimer reckon more directly with the aftermath of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Take a step back, though, and a film about an intelligent and very capable man wrestling with huge moral issues is very much in the Nolan wheelhouse.At one point in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb dons his iconic uniform \u2014 a fedora cap, a smoking pipe, a slightly over-sized suit \u2014 like Batman wearing his cape and cowl for the first time.That was particularly surprising since it's really a movie featuring people (mostly men) talking to each other in a series of unremarkable rooms.Like a Nolan heist film, he assembles a team of the brightest scientific minds in America and beyond, and he pushes the government to establish a town doubling as a secret research base in Los Alamos, New Mexico.Universal Pictures\nStill, it's an overall disjointed experience.The few featured women \u2014 Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, Florence Pugh as the Communist activist Jean Tatlock \u2014 are sketched thin, even by Nolan standards.But even those scenes feel self-serving.Oppenheimer's\u00a0swaggering genius fits right alongside Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman, the dedicated magicians in The Prestige or the expert dream divers/super spies in Inception.(Something that will come back to haunt him later.)",

            "paraphrased_content": "However, this probably won\u2019t happen, with the consensus among leaks being that it will be limited to 25W again.There is, however, hope for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, because Samsung is reportedly changing up the charging technology in the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which could see it offer 65W charging, so perhaps this same tech will make its way to a future Samsung foldable.7.Faster chargingThe Galaxy Z Fold 4 is one of the slower charging flagships (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)As well as a bigger battery, we\u2019d really like to see Samsung start embracing faster charging.We\u2019ve also heard that the Z Fold 5 might have an improved under-display selfie camera.3.Almost certainly not.But another Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 price leak suggests an increase in price.5.The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is almost here, with this best foldable phone contender set to be announced at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2023 on July 26.As such, we\u2019ll know all about it very soon, and thanks to a large number of leaks and rumors we already have a good idea of what to expect.15% doesn\u2019t sound great, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.4.That said, some camera improvements probably are coming, with Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 camera leaks pointing to one or more new sensors (albeit with the same megapixel counts as the Z Fold 4).But what we\u2019re hearing is something of a mixed bag \u2013 while numerous improvements do seem to be planned, a lot of areas could still use more attention.With that in mind we\u2019ve created this list of things that we really want to see from the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5.Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra-caliber camerasThe S23 Ultra has better cameras than Samsung's foldables (Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)One constant complaint we have with Samsung\u2019s foldable phones is that while the cameras are generally decent, they\u2019re far from matching the best of what the company has to offer.If photography is your priority, then you\u2019ll pick a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra with its 200MP main sensor and periscope zoom, over the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 with its more pedestrian selection of cameras.Many other non-foldable phones also have bigger batteries than that.This isn\u2019t a problem that\u2019s exclusive to Samsung\u2019s foldable phones and it\u2019s presumably because the need for a second screen and a hinge eats up valuable battery space, but it\u2019s a problem that we\u2019d like to see solved.Unfortunately it probably won\u2019t be solved this year, with reports suggesting the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 once again has a 4,400mAh battery.There is hope for a future model though, as it\u2019s rumored that Samsung is using a new stacked battery design in the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, allowing for 10% more capacity to fit in the same space.No creaseThere's no escaping the crease on the Galaxy Z Fold 4 (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)All current foldable phones have a crease in the screen at the point where it folds.This needn\u2019t be the case \u2013 after all, the Google Pixel Fold has a far more sensibly shaped cover screen, so we\u2019d love to see the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 follow suit.Will it do?Dust resistanceThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 lacks dust resistance (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)Samsung\u2019s recent foldable phones have decent water resistance, but what they\u2019re still lacking is any real dust resistance, so it would be reassuring if the Z Fold 5 could add this.Unlike a lot of the things on this list, there\u2019s some hope that it might too, with a leaker claiming that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 will have an IP58 rating.The \u20185\u2019 there is the key number, as this would mean a significant level of dust resistance.Not all sources agree though, with another claiming that the Z Fold 5 \u201cdoes not meet the IP58 dust-proof standard.\u201d So this is one thing that we\u2019re currently unsure about.They\u2019re not all things that we\u2019ve heard leaked, so don\u2019t count on all these upgrades being included, they\u2019re just what Samsung really should improve in our view.1.A lower priceThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 sure is expensive (Image credit: Future / Lanc eUlanoff)High-end tech is always expensive, and in the world of phones you don\u2019t get higher-end than foldable ones; particularly the large ones that fold out into more of a tablet-sized device, which is what we\u2019re expecting from the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5.As such, it\u2019s sure to cost a lot, but we\u2019d really like to see it at least cost less than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4, which starts at $1,799 / \u00a31,649 / AU$2,499.This though looks extremely unlikely, going by the leaks we\u2019ve heard so far.But with the Galaxy Z Fold 4 being Samsung\u2019s most expensive phone, it shouldn\u2019t be that way.With the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 launching on July 26 though, we\u2019ll find out soon enough.Leaks suggest the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 will have a 6.2-inch cover screen just like its predecessor, and leaked Galaxy Z Fold 5 renders show a shape that appears very similar.2.But the Galaxy Z Fold 4 doesn\u2019t even manage 45W \u2013 it tops out at 25W.As such, it would be great if Samsung could provide a speed boost to the charging on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5.This crease is both visible and present under-finger, albeit to varying degrees \u2013 depending on the phone in question.While most people will quickly get used to the crease, it\u2019s not ideal, so we\u2019d love it if somehow the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 didn't have a crease down the center of its main screen.From what we\u2019ve heard, it probably will have a crease, but a smaller one than before, with a leak pointing to a 15% reduction in the Galaxy Z Fold 5\u2019s crease size, thanks to the use of a new waterdrop hinge design.If so, there\u2019s every chance this tech will make it to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6.6.Best case, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 might cost the same as the Z Fold 4.A bigger batteryWith big screens the Fold line could do with big batteries (Image credit: Future)The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 will probably have a screen that\u2019s almost the size of a small tablet, and at that size it could really do with a big battery to keep it lit up for longer.The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4, though, has just a 4,400mAh battery, which is a full 600mAh smaller than the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\u2019s battery.Sadly, it seems unlikely.A wider cover screenThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 has a very narrow cover screen (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)If you look at a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 when it\u2019s folded shut then one thing will probably immediately strike you \u2013 its cover screen is quite narrow.At 6.2 inches it\u2019s the size of a normal smartphone display, but the 23.1:9 aspect ratio is rather different, making it a bit more awkward to use than a typical handset.Even on the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the charging power tops out at 45W, which isn\u2019t much when you consider that some phones \u2013 such as the OnePlus 10T \u2013 charge at as much as 150W.We shouldn\u2019t have to compromise.So for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, we\u2019d like to see the same selection of rear cameras as is found on the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra; meaning a 200MP wide, a 12MP ultra-wide, a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 10MP periscope with 10x optical zoom.Will we get this?",

            "paraphrased_content": "Image: Parrish Lewis / Netflix\n\nThough They Cloned Tyrone\u2019s reality becomes exponentially more heightened and outlandish as the movie unfolds, Boyega brings a subtle depth to his performance as Fontaine that immediately makes his complicated relationship with the Glen feel real.On one hand, They Cloned Tyrone\u2019s a story about Fontaine, Yo-Yo, and Slick Charles realizing that someone or something out there is cloning people from the Glen and setting out to learn why.But between Fontaine tragically losing his younger brother, financially supporting his shut-in mother, and having few other viable options at his disposal, it makes far more sense from his perspective to make a living selling drugs to cash-strapped pimps like Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx) than trying to work a 9-to-5.But the movie also wants you thinking about what it is you\u2019re laughing at, exactly \u2014 its absurdity, its jokes, or the hard realities behind the fantastical horror playing out on-screen.Foxx\u2019s Slick Charles \u2014 a vintage hustler who\u2019s well aware of how helpless he\u2019d be without women like Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris) who\u2019ve worked for him \u2014 seems plucked out of time and feels just shy of being a caricature.But when Fontaine wakes up the next morning and starts going about his day \u2014 the very same beats he hit the day before \u2014 the movie takes on a disquieting kind of Groundhog Day-like quality that works to illustrate a number of interesting ideas.Instead, the jokes in Taylor and co-writer Tony Rettenmaier\u2019s script feel much more like the sort of humor that stems from having a deep understanding of how pernicious structural racism is and making light of it to keep from being enraged.Set almost entirely in an economically depressed but vibrant Black neighborhood somewhere in America, They Cloned Tyrone tells the tale of how dope dealer Fontaine (John Boyega) accidentally discovers an alarming truth about the place he\u2019s called home for his entire life.Image: Parrish Lewis / Netflix\n\nBecause the subject matter that They Cloned Tyrone is talking about \u2014 the meaning behind the clones and the way that Fontaine feels existentially stuck in the Glen \u2014 is so heavy, the film\u2019s Sorry to Bother You-esque absurdity never exactly feels silly.Fontaine knows exactly where Isaac\u2019s corner boys are usually posted up, just like he knows that he can always rely on Biddy (Tamberla Perry) and the Glen\u2019s other sex workers to cough up information about where people are for the right price.But between its trio of rock-solid lead performances, inspired musical direction from Philippe Pierre and Stephanie Diaz-Matos, and a clever finale that brings the whole thing home, that bumpiness is part of They Cloned Tyrone\u2019s charm and all the more reason to give it a watch.As strong as They Cloned Tyrone\u2019s first two-thirds are, its final act feels more than a little slapdash in terms of how it tries to tie up multiple plots with an ambitious set piece that involves almost all of the movie\u2019s players.The almost cartoonish goofiness that\u2019s present throughout most of They Cloned Tyrone comes to an abrupt halt early on when Fontaine\u2019s suddenly murdered in cold blood, with both Yo-Yo and Slick Charles witnessing the ordeal go down.Fontaine also knows that people like himself and Isaac \u2014 men who conduct their business violently and with little consideration for the hardships other people are dealing with \u2014 are part of what makes the Glen a dangerous place for kids like Junebug (Trayce Malachi) to grow up in.But it\u2019s also a story somewhat in the style of Spike Lee\u2019s Bamboozled or about a Black community reckoning with the ways in which it\u2019s surveilled and how many of the structural challenges it faces are there by design.But when Fontaine comes to shake Slick down for cash, and Boyega gets to play straight man opposite Foxx tapping into all of his charisma while Parris steals the scene with one-liners about crypto and the blockchain, the three characters make a perfect kind of sense in each other\u2019s contexts.As a local from the Glen \u2014 the small chunk of town where Fontaine pushes his products while trying to edge out competitors like Isaac (J. Alphonse Nicholson) \u2014 there\u2019s little about his stomping grounds that he isn\u2019t intimately familiar with.The movie is now streaming on Netflix.More than anything else, They Cloned Tyrone \u2014 Netflix\u2019s new conspiracy theory-minded, sci-fi comedy thriller from director Juel Taylor \u2014 wants to make you laugh with its wild story about a secret organization terrorizing an unsuspecting Black neighborhood from the shadows.They Cloned Tyrone also stars David Alan Grier, Kiefer Sutherland, Eric Robinson Jr., Leon Lamar, and Joshua Mikel.",

            "paraphrased_content": "And because their atoms are more structured, these bridges can better allow the flow of electrons.Captured with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), the photographs showcase the increased order in the deposition of hafnium oxide (disordered and natural deposition, as in image A) when tunneled by the dynamically changeable Barium spikes.A research team helmed by Markus Hellbrand et al.New research along the frontiers of materials engineering holds promise for a truly astounding performance improvement for computing devices.With the system processing different states at full speed (working as a GPU or CPU, for instance), that means the barium bridges would cease functioning (hit their endurance limit) at around the 0,002-second mark (remember, it's only operating at 50 MHz).Storing means that the information needs to be static\u00a0for a longer period of time \u2014 perhaps because it's part of the Windows or Linux kernels, for instance.To build these synapse devices, as the paper refers to them, the research team had to find a way to deal with a materials engineering bottleneck known as the uniformity problem.They found switching endurances of >10^4 cycles, with a memory window >10.This allows it to function at increased varieties of voltages, which in turn allows for more information to be encoded.That doesn't seem like it could be performant enough for a processing unit.But for storage?At a high enough level, this is much the same process happening in the NAND realm, with increases in bits per cell corresponding to a higher number of possible voltage states unlocked in the memory cell's design.One way to differentiate processing from storing is saying that processing means that the information is undergoing writes and rewrites (additions or subtractions, transformations or reorganizations) as fast as its switching cycle is requested to.There's a world where that graphics card comes with a reset factory state where it's entirely operating as memory (now imagine a graphics card with 10 TB of it, the same as our hypothetical USB stick).Imagine a world where what AMD and Nvidia offered were essentially programmable GPUs, with continuous range-based GPU dies product-stacked in terms of maximum storage capability (remember the 10 to 100 denser than current USB).Because hafnium oxide (HfO2) doesn't possess any structure at the atomic level, the hafnium and oxygen atoms that can make or break its insulating properties are deposited haphazardly.While conventional memory is capable of just two states (one or zero, the cause for the \"binary\" nomenclature), a resistive switching memory device can change its resistance through a range of states.But the team found that depositing barium (Ba) within the thin films of unstructured hafnium oxide resulted in highly-ordered barium bridges (or spikes).Even though this isn't as dangerous an issue as AI development and its regulation, there's little to be gained in dreaming so far ahead.\u201cIn conventional computing, there\u2019s memory on one side and processing on the other, and data is shuffled back between the two, which takes both energy and time.\u201dThe benefits of merging both memory and processing are quite spectacular, as you might imagine.So much so, in fact, that a typical USB stick based on the technology (which is called continuous range) could hold between 10 and 100 times more information than the ones we currently use.With RAM doubling in density every four years, as pointed out by JEDEC, it'd take RAM makers decades to eventually achieve the same level of density as this technology has shown today.The device is also a light at the tunnel of neuromorphic computing.and associated with the University of Cambridge believes the new material, based of hafnium oxide layers tunneled by voltage-changing barium spikes, fuses the properties of memory and processing-bound materials.Like the neurons in our brain, the material (known as a resistive switching memory) holds the promise of working as both a storage and processing medium.Even if that meant a measured decay in the longevity of parts of our chip.We're always upgrading them anyway, aren't we?But let's not get ahead of ourselves.Better yet, the semiconductor industry already works with hafnium oxide, so there are fewer tooling and logistics nightmares to fight through.But here's a particularly ingenious product possibility: imagine that the technology improves to the point that it's fabricated and useable to design an AMD or Nvidia GPU (which these days operate at around the 2 GHz mark).(Image credit: Cambridge University/Markus Hellbrand et al.Like all technology, it'll come - when it's ready.in computing, this is known as von Neumann's bottleneck, meaning that a system with separate memory and processing capabilities will be fundamentally limited by the bandwidth between them both (what's usually known as the bus).Well, that's where the USB stick that's \"10 to 100 times denser\" in terms of memory capacity comes in.If you are an AI aficionado attempting to build your own Large Language Model (LLM), you can program your GPU so that just the right amount of these synthetic devices, these neuromorphic transistors, runs processing functions \u2014 there's no telling how many trillion parameters models will eventually end up as their complexity increases, so memory will grow increasingly more important.Being able to dictate whether the transistors in your graphics card are used exactly as memory or exactly as eye-candy-amplifiers to turn graphics settings up to eleven, that'd be entirely up to the end-user; from casual gamer to High Performance Computing (HPC) installer.Of course, there's also the sustainability factor: it's expected that computing will consume as much as 30% of the worldwide energy needs in the not-so-distant future.\u201cTo a large extent, this explosion in energy demands is due to shortcomings of current computer memory technologies,\u201d said first author Dr. Markus Hellenbrand, from Cambridge\u2019s Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy.Remember that when energy circulates, there are also inherent losses, which result in increased power consumption (a current hard limit on our hardware designs and a growing priority in semiconductor design) as well as heat \u2014 yet another hard limit that's led to the development of increasingly exotic cooling solutions to try and allow Moore's law to limp ahead for a while yet.They found that the spikes could offer switching capabilities at a rate of ~20ns, meaning that they could change their voltage state (and thus hold different information) within that window.This means that while the material is fast, the maximum number of voltage state changes it can currently withstand stands at around 10,000 cycles - not a terrible result, but not an amazing one.It's equivalent to the endurance available with MLC (Multi-Level Cell) technology, which will naturally limit its application - the usage of this material as a processing medium (where voltage states are rapidly changed in order to keep a store of calculations and their intermediate results).Doing some rough napkin math, the ~20 ns switching leads to an operating frequency of 50 MHz (converting to cycles per nanosecond).)But the fun began when the research team found they could dynamically change the height of the barium spikes, allowing for fine-grained control of their electrical conductivity.That's something that simply doesn't happen in our current semiconductor technology: the transistor and materials design arrangements are so different between what you need for a memory cell and what you need for a processing one (mainly in terms of endurance, as in, the ability not to suffer performance degradations) that there's currently no way to merge them.This inability to merge them means that information must be continuously flowing between the processing system and its various caches (when thinking of a modern CPU), as well as its external memory pool (looking at you, best DDR5 kits on the market).This is why all semiconductor design companies (from Intel through AMD, Nvidia, and many others) design dedicated hardware that accelerates this exchange of information, such as Infinity Fabric and NVLink.The problem is that this exchange of information has an energy cost, and this energy cost is currently limiting the upper bounds of achievable performance.This limits its application for conducting electrons (electrical power); the more ordered the atomic structure is, the least resistance will be caused, so the higher the speed and efficiency.These synapse devices can access a lot more intermediate voltage states than even the densest NAND technology in today's roomiest USB sticks can - by a factor of 10 or 100.Who wouldn't love to have a 10 TeraByte or even 100 TeraByte \"USB 7\" stick on their hands?There's some work to be done in terms of endurance and switching speed of the barium bridges, but it seems like the design is already an enticing proof of concept.Published in the Science Advances journal, the research gives us a road through which we might end with far greater density, performance and energy efficiency in our computing devices.if it ever is.That means the devices could work for data storage, offering anywhere from 10 to 100 times the density of existing storage mediums, or it could be used as a processing unit.",

            "paraphrased_content": "For starters, the fantasy story is painfully boring.The gameplay feels as good as I remember it, but there are some improved visuals and other quality-of-life tweaks, including a revamped online mode that I haven\u2019t tested yet.There are lots of games that have attempted to wed role-playing with puzzle-solving, but few have done so as seamlessly as Clash of Heroes.Tucked away in between those two releases was Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes \u2014 which originally debuted on the Nintendo DS \u2014 an often overlooked game that might just be the most engrossing puzzle RPG I\u2019ve ever played.The goal (usually) is to deplete your enemy\u2019s health by pushing your attacks through the warriors in front of them.But those are easy to look past here: the new version looks incredible and, more importantly, offers the same satisfying mix of swords, sorcery, and puzzle-solving.Success becomes a combination of making smart, efficient moves, and paying close attention to the timing of your (and your opponent\u2019s) attacks.There are all kinds of unique battles with tricky win conditions; in the first few hours, you\u2019ll have to prevent an ancient elven tree from being chopped down and defeat an army while not harming a particular unit.The complexity ramps up pretty quickly.Some of the battles are very demanding, and it\u2019s easy to get in over your head, which often necessitates grinding through some of the \u201coptional\u201d missions.There are also quests where the goal is to kill all of the enemy units in a single turn.I first realized this when playing the colorful Critter Crunch way back in 2009, and nowadays, I\u2019m reminded of it whenever I squeeze in a few rounds of Grindstone on my phone.The game is turn-based, so you\u2019ll make a few moves before switching over to your opponent, like in a classic Final Fantasy-style RPG.There are a lot of reasons that Clash of Heroes was overlooked in the first place, not least of which is the generic name and story.Match three of the same type vertically, and they\u2019ll get ready to attack; match them up horizontally, and they\u2019ll create a defensive wall.Of course, since the battles are the fun part, this isn\u2019t too annoying, but you should definitely be aware of the challenge ahead.I\u2019ve played this game multiple times on multiple platforms, but I could barely tell you the story.Basically, the things you are matching are soldiers and other combat units, and matching them is how you do battle.It keeps things fresh and challenging.All that said, while I love this game, there are some things you should be aware of before jumping in.It\u2019s also a game that constantly surprises you.Now it has a new lease on life with a rerelease for modern platforms.Also: Clash of Heroes is hard.There are different types of units, all with unique styles of attacks, some of which take a few turns before they\u2019re unleashed.The screen is divided into two halves \u2014 you on the bottom, your opponent on top \u2014 and you\u2019re presented with a grid full of different kinds of units that you can move around.There are some fun bits of dialogue, but I always find myself racing through the cutscenes to get to the good stuff.Image: Dotemu\n\nThe new \u201cdefinitive edition\u201d was put together by Dotemu, the team behind some other recent retro revivals like Streets of Rage 4 and TMNT: Shredder\u2019s Revenge, and is largely based on the beautiful console version that came out in 2012.Clash of Heroes is a match-three game, but in practice, it\u2019s quite different from something like Candy Crush or even Puzzle Quest.I\u2019ll admit that I miss how perfectly the game fit on the DS\u2019s dual screens (what a surprise), but that aside, this is an ideal port.Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes is out now on the Switch, Steam, and PS4.It\u2019s like a sudoku puzzle, only in fantasy warfare form.The team over at Capy Games has a real knack for inventive takes on seemingly simple puzzle games.",

manually update games, select the drive, then choose View content > Manage > Updates.When you\u2019re removing a drive from your Xbox, power down the console first before unplugging it.(exFAT drives can be read by both Windows and Mac as well as Linux machines.)However, if you choose that, games won\u2019t be updated automatically.As noted earlier, the PS5 comes with a slot for expanding the internal storage via an M.2 SSD, and you can find out how to perform the upgrade here.The steps for installing and working with the Storage Expansion Card or an external drive are almost the same, with the only difference being that you might have to format an external SSD or HDD if you haven\u2019t used it before.Still, it\u2019s more convenient than having to wait for PS5 games you\u2019ve bought to be downloaded again.You can change the default installation locations at any time.You have options.This lets you specify whether the drive is being used with one or multiple Xbox consoles: the latter lets you easily switch games between Xboxes.There\u2019s no internal expansion slot like there is on the PS5, so if you need more room, you have to go external.To move PS5 games to external storage:\n\nOpen Settings and choose Storage > Console Storage > Games and Apps.On the Xbox side, you can buy storage expansion cards that plug into a designated slot on the back of the console for a quick and easy (if often expensive) upgrade.How to add an external drive to a PS5\n\nOnce system files are taken into account, there\u2019s only about 667GB of internal storage space on a PlayStation 5.RelatedThere\u2019s never been a better time to buy an SSD for your PC or PS5\n\nAdding external storage drives can help ease the pressure, too, giving you plug-and-play access to gigabytes or even terabytes of additional storage.Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge\n\nThe official Storage Expansion Card option is the best choice here because you\u2019re ensured\u00a0 a seamless and high-speed storage experience, but it\u2019s also the most expensive (although prices have fallen drastically recently).It\u2019s the same process for moving them back: just pick USB Extended Storage instead of Console Storage in the Storage menu to find the games you want to move.And because you\u2019re simply attaching an external drive, this isn\u2019t a complicated or time-consuming operation \u2014 though there are a few technical points of order that you need to be aware of.(Games made for older Xbox consoles can be stored externally and will run from an external drive, too.)It\u2019s not difficult to open up a PS5 and install an M.2 SSD, but it\u2019s even easier to just plug in an external drive.Choose Change installation locations to tell your Xbox where to save new Xbox Series X / S games, backward-compatible (older) games, and apps by default.Image: Tom Warren / The Verge\n\nPlugging an external drive into a spare USB port on the PS5 is quicker and easier, but it comes with more caveats.You can eject the drive in Settings via Storage > USB Extended Storage > Safely Remove from PS5.Any SSD or HDD you plug in must be between 256GB and 8TB in size and support 5Gbps transfer speeds or better \u2014 commonly referred to as USB 3.0, USB 3.1, and USB 3.2, or sometimes \u201cSuperSpeed USB.\u201d This means most modern drives will work but not old USB 2.0 ones.Alternatively, you can use your own choice of SSD or HDD and plug it into any spare USB port on the Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S as long as they offer a capacity of 128GB or more and speeds of USB 3.0 or faster.This will be cheaper, but you won\u2019t be able to run games made for the current-generation Xbox from the drive, only store them \u2014 they\u2019ll need to be moved back to internal storage if you want to play them.You may have to format your external drive in order to use it.Select a game, then Select Items to Move, and you can pick one or more titles to move over to the drive you just connected.Only Seagate and Western Digital make these cards at the moment, in 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB capacities, and they slot straight into the dedicated slot on the back of the Xbox.To wipe it, select it on the Storage devices page, then choose Format.Select one or more of your games and then Move selected to transfer them to an external drive for storage or the internal drive for playing.Also on the\u00a0Storage devices screen, when you choose an external drive, you\u2019ll see\u00a0a Change how drive is configured option.As your console game collection grows, you\u2019re going to need more space to store it \u2014 and the internal storage inside your PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X / S isn\u2019t going to last forever.The PlayStation 5 has an internal slot for expanding the onboard storage that\u2019s pretty easy to access by popping off a couple of panels and turning a single screw.That may leave you in a situation where you\u2019re regularly uninstalling and reinstalling games, juggling them around to fit the available space.Considering that a game such as Horizon Forbidden West can take up almost 90GB on its own, it\u2019s clear that serious gamers are going to come to a point where that space runs out.If it\u2019s a new drive or a drive you\u2019ve used for something else, you may then see a prompt on the screen asking for permission to format it to make it ready for use.With any type of storage, you\u2019ll see a message asking if you want to change the location settings for storing games \u2014 you can do this when prompted if you want, but the same screens can be found by opening Settings (via the cog icon at the top of the interface), then System > Storage devices.Once you\u2019ve bought your new SSD or HDD storage (or repurposed a drive from elsewhere), plug it directly into one of the large USB-A ports on the back of your PS5 or the small USB-C port around front, as Sony recommends.The Xbox Series X has an easily accessed external slot for an expansion card.Open Settings (the cog icon at the top of the interface).Pick Storage > USB Extended Storage > Format as USB Extended Storage to start the process.Note: any PS4 games you install will automatically place themselves on the attached external drive.You can double-check compatibility with the seller when buying.How to add an external drive to an Xbox Series X / S\n\nWhen it comes to the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S, you get 1TB or 512GB of internal storage space, respectively \u2014 though, in reality, it\u2019s not that much when system files are taken into account.From Settings, select Storage > Installation Location > PS4 Games and Apps.Before you can use an external drive, you need to format it.The console will treat the SSD almost like internal storage, and you can run games straight from it.You can use these drives for storing and playing PS4 games, but they can only store PS5 games.It\u2019s simple enough to move games between internal and external storage.In each case, you can pick an internal or external drive or choose Let Xbox decide, which means a choice will be made for you based on where the most storage space is available.If you want to change the location of a game, go back to the Storage devices screen, choose an internal or external drive, and then click Move or copy.You can also wipe it by selecting the three dots just to the right of the Safely Remove from PS5 button, then Format as exFAT.Before you can use a drive, you\u2019ll need to format it.(When you want to actually play them, you\u2019ll need to move them back to the internal storage.)While this is probably the most convenient place to keep them, if you want to switch this for any reason \u2014 for example, if you\u2019re not going to have your external drive always connected to your PS5 \u2014 you can.If you\u2019re using a Seagate or Western Digital storage expansion card, plug the card into the designated slot around the back: it\u2019s just above the power cable socket on both consoles and is labeled Storage Expansion.If you\u2019re using a different external drive, you can plug it into any of the USB ports on the front or back of your Xbox.",

the destruction of Twitter by the coward Elon Musk; the AI glurge polluting the open web; the needless login prompts.So maybe it\u2019s time to think about what a web of people looks like now.But if you look around, the world itself is still pretty vibrant, while the web seems to look like the set of Blade Runner.Forget VR headsets.Suddenly, being online was more accessible than it had ever been.The retreat to group chats (Discord, iMessage, Telegram, WhatsApp) looks \u2014 from where I\u2019m standing \u2014 like a return to messaging and ye old-fashioned chat room (RIP Firefly).Baby doll, it is easier than ever to build your own website, and you don\u2019t even need to know the basics required to rip someone else\u2019s code.And what\u2019s good for Google or Facebook is not necessarily what\u2019s good for you.Suddenly, being online was more accessible than it had ever been\n\nThere were, in the beginning, a lot of upsides to Web 2.0.I don\u2019t begrudge people their hobbies, but I don\u2019t think crypto solves this.)Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and \u2014 later \u2014TikTok made it child\u2019s play to suddenly become famous, so much so that people started filming strangers in public for clout.It\u2019s certainly possible \u2014 even delightful \u2014 to teach them the old ways.There is certainly a shift happening, and it\u2019s not yet clear how this is going to play out.There is certainly a shift happening, and it\u2019s not yet clear how this is going to play out\n\nOne of the big things the platforms offered was an audience.At first, it was fun!Get in, loser, we\u2019re going back to Web 1.0.What kinds of communities can we build with the people who\u2019ve come online since then?What does the web look like if we decide to erase everything we\u2019ve done since the dot-com crash?More people than ever are online and have the kinds of rudimentary skills they didn\u2019t at the beginning of Web 2.0.Mastodon and Bluesky are pretty niche, Threads is probably DOA, and it looks like Reddit is pushing its own exodus.And that made it feel better than the regular web, where pop-ups and pop-unders were a scourge, and banner ads were everywhere.Maybe now\u2019s the time to do it.We have the opportunity to get out from under the algorithms.If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from observing Silicon Valley, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t have to be smart to be a programmer; anyone can learn how to code.Fuck it, group chat.Before social media, going viral was much harder; actual people had to pass your site or video along, via email or chat usually.Companies took over the web, but that doesn\u2019t mean they get to keep it.If you want to make the internet good again, it\u2019s time to go rogue, and a bunch of us already know how.Take the YouTubers, who have over the years had to adapt their content to the whims of Google, or Instagrammers, who have had to dance to whatever new tune Mark Zuckerberg is playing.Plenty of you have done it already \u2014 I know because you oldheads keep emailing me.But then, of course, things began to change.The era of Web 2.0 is ending.",

            "paraphrased_content": "(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)You can then compare with the length, width, and height values in the slicer and see if they are within the same range.It has precise dimensions, such as 20mm on each side.Stringing is where thin filament strands accumulate on your design, as shown below.In my case, I only increased the speed, and it came out without many issues, even though the tip of the towers were a little affected.Creative Tools initially created it, and you can get it from 3D Benchy's official website, where different STL file-sharing websites are listed, like Thingiverse, Printables, Cults3D, and many others and you can click any of those websites, and you will access it.When you download the file from the official website, you need to print it as it is (at a scale of 1:1) without adjusting any settings.Below we\u2019ve chosen the six best test models for 3D printing.1.If your retraction settings are not correctly set, you will experience stringing.Calibration CubeThe XYZ calibration cube helps tune the dimensional accuracy of your 3D printer.In addition to being small in size, it has overhangs with varying angles to test how the 3D printer handles bridges.Additionally, the circular holes on the model, rectangular windows, and each section of the design have a specific size (as seen in the brochure), and you need to measure the model after 3D printing and see how accurate your 3D printer is.It allows you to evaluate the print quality at different temperatures and determine the ideal temperature range for your filament.The flow rate is the rate at which the extruder extrudes the filament from the nozzle and is measured in millimeters per second.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)5.Doing so will allow you to see what your printer, whether it\u2019s one of the best 3D printers or not, is capable of and ensure that you won\u2019t waste your time and materials on a project that won\u2019t work.Test prints will allow you to analyze how the printer handles overhangs, holes, and supports and know which settings like temperature, speed, layer height, and retraction work best for your 3D printer or filament.In addition to helping you know if your machine is well calibrated, it can also help identify issues related to under or over-extrusion and even steps per millimeter.3.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)After 3D printing, you should examine every part of the model and see how your machine handles them.If the size of your prints is far from the size in the digital file, this is an important test print you need to use to troubleshoot the issue.To print this model, you must orient it properly in the slicer and ensure the letters are parallel to the axis you are measuring, as shown below.All-in-One 3D Printer Test(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)As the name suggests, the all-in-one 3D printer test tests how your 3D printer handles various designs, from overhangs, supports, hole tests, temperature, and even bridging.But if you're going to know the various aspects of your machine generally, you can begin with the simple cube, then go to complex designs like the 3D Benchy before moving to an all-in-one 3D printer test that covers everything.Through this, you will know how precise are your stepper motors when moving.A lower flow rate reduces the speed and produces prints with finer details.3D Benchy(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)3D Benchy is one of the most popular benchmark designs you can use to test the capability of your 3D printer.Retraction TestThe retraction test model helps test how your 3D printer retracts or pulls the filament back to the nozzle as it moves from one end to the other.If your 3D printer is set correctly, it will print these sections well, but the holes can be smaller than expected if there are issues.You should check the holes settings in your 3D slicer to see if they are covered or not well visible.After 3D printing, measure the three sides and note the values.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)If the sizes are much different, you will need to fine-tune your machine until you achieve almost that range.You will be able to identify if there are issues in any part and see which course of action to take.For example, in my case, I saw stringing around in some sections of the design, and this meant that I needed to adjust the retraction and temperature settings to fix the issue.The complex nature of the design makes it the perfect print to troubleshoot and tune your machine.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)In most cases, the model will be imported facing the right direction.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)You can also test how your 3D printer controls temperature and cooling by checking the overall quality of the print, like if the surfaces are smooth or have rough surfaces or blots, and you need to adjust the settings on your slicer to fix the issue.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)If the strings appear even after Increasing the retraction speed, you can increase the retraction distance too.If you know the issue you want to troubleshoot, you can pick the appropriate design and use it for testing.If you\u2019ve just received your 3D printer or are looking forward to 3D printing a complex design, starting with a test print is essential.For example, you can uncheck the Remove All Holes option in Cura so that the holes are not removed.A higher rate, on the other hand, reduces the 3D printing time, though if it\u2019s too high, it can result in issues like over-extrusion.If you experience issues like oozing, over-extrusion, and poor-quality prints, it\u2019s essential to 3D print this test model and use it to troubleshoot the problem.The above are just but a few of the many available test prints.Smart Compact Temperature Calibration Tower(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Smart compact temperature calibration tower helps calibrate your 3D printer and filament.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)If you experience stringing, you need to adjust the retraction speed in your slicer; in most cases, you need to increase it a little so that the filament retracts quickly and does not have the time to ooze out as the print head moves.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The print will also help you understand how holes and walls of your designs will be 3D printed, and you can change the speed, temperature, and other settings to ensure that it is printed accurately.4.You can even use test prints to see how fast your high-speed printer can go.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)2.After printing, you need to measure its dimensions with a caliper or other measurement tools to see if it is the intended size.The temperature segments in the design increase gradually, and it\u2019s easier to know how each section has been 3D printed.The designer suggests printing at an infill of 15% and 0.2mm resolution, and you should not use supports.Flowrate Calibration Print(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Flowrate calibration print is another test print that helps calibrate the flow rate of your 3D printer.Most of these just take a few minutes or hours to print, so you can be sure they won\u2019t waste your time or material.MORE: Best 3D PrintersMORE: Best Budget 3D PrintingMORE: Best Resin 3D PrintersIt affects the quality of prints and printing speed.You can analyze the design after 3D printing and adjust your temperature settings accordingly.6.(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The small holes that protrude from inside to the top and the wheel-like shape are essential in testing how your machine handles fine details and intricate designs.While you can use any model to test out your printer, there are several which are designed specifically for that purpose.After downloading and slicing the files, the designer suggests using 100% infill with no supports.",

and most importantly, the prices of the 14th Gen Intel Raptor Lake refresh family.All chips are 65W designs and besides the Core i5-14400, all share the same specs as the \"K\" SKUs.Just like the last gen, the 14th gen will not have any \"F\" variants of Core i5-14600 or Core i5-14500.Intel Core i7-14700K CPU Specifications\nFor the Core i7-14700K, Intel will be utilizing its 8+12 core configuration which offers 20 cores and 28 threads.The base clocks are mentioned but the Core i5-14400 features a 6+4 configuration which means there's a total of 10 cores and 16 threads.It will feature clock speeds of 3.2 GHz at the base and up to 6.0 GHz with Thermal Velocity Boost.Intel 14th Gen Raptor Lake Desktop Non-K CPU Refresh Lineup Specs & Prices Leaked\nIntel will be unveiled its 14th Gen Raptor Lake Refresh Desktop CPU lineup in September followed by a launch in October.Intel 14th Gen Raptor Lake Refresh Non-K Desktop Lineup Specs\nFor the Non-K lineup, leaker, chi11eddog has revealed specs of at least five SKUs which include the Core i9-14900, Core i7-14700, Core i5-14600, Core i5-14500, & the Core i5-14400.These frequencies are currently for the pre-QS stage so we might see the rumored 6.2 GHz on either this chip or a \"KS\" variant later down the road.Intel Core i5-14600K CPU Specifications\nLastly, we have the Intel Core i5-14600K which unfortunately isn't using an 8+8 configuration as the rumors had told but rather a 6+8 which is the same as the Core i5-13600K.Which Intel 14th Gen \"K\" SKU do you find the most interesting?It is mentioned in the leak that the 14th Gen CPUs will feature the same prices as the 13th Gen SKUs.Besides that, we also get to know the specifications of the Non-K lineup but Core i3 SKUs are missing at the moment.The company has an\u00a0Innovation event planned for 19th September\u00a0so we can expect more details then.The cache and TDP will remain the same but the clock speeds will see a +200 MHz to 5.3 GHz, offering up to a 5% boost in performance over its predecessor.That's also a +200 MHz boost over the 13700K & we can see performance uplifts of around 5-10% from this particular SKU.This will be a nice upgrade over the existing Core i7-13700K which offers an 8+8 core configuration, allowing for a nice boost to multi-threading performance thanks to those extra E-Cores.Regardless, this will be a +200 MHz frequency jump over the Core i9-13900K and the same as the Core i9-13900KS.The specifications of Intel's 14th Gen Raptor Lake Refresh Non-K Desktop CPU lineup have been leaked & will feature similar prices as

seen from AOC for the past decade, and it is relatively intuitive though a little clunky to navigate with buttons.But this is a minor point that only someone accustomed to large high-res screens will experience.All will run at FHD resolution at 240 Hz, but you\u2019ll need to use DisplayPort for G-Sync.27 inches is the largest FHD monitor I would care to use, but the C27G2Z\u2019s 82ppi is enough to get the job done for both work and play.You get an aiming point and a frame counter in the OSD, fairly accurate color, and good results from calibration.51 nits)Contrast47Gamma1Color Temp UserRed 49, Green 52, Blue 51Gaming and Hands-onI\u2019ll get the question of resolution answered first.It lets you create a bright section on the screen that can be sized and moved about.The C27G2Z does not process HDR10 signals, but it does include three HDR emulation modes that tweak gamma to produce a little more punch to the image.The C27G2Z doesn\u2019t need calibration, but a small improvement is possible with a few tweaks.It\u2019s snappy and responsive with the reasonably smooth motion one would expect from a 240 Hz panel.It hasn\u2019t been certified by Nvidia, but I can confirm that it runs G-Sync just fine.Image quality is enhanced by a VA panel that met its claimed 3,000:1 contrast ratio in my tests.Setting the panel this way gives you the full potential of the curve\u2019s immersive effect.The input panel has two HDMI 2.0 ports and a DisplayPort 1.2.You won\u2019t need a premium video card to hit 240fps.Picture quality is top-notch thanks to the C27G2Z\u2019s excellent contrast and wide-gamut color.They assemble without tools into a reasonably solid and lightweight package.There are no built-in speakers, nor are there any USB ports.If you look closely at the tiny white power LED at the lower right, you\u2019ll see molded-in symbols for the five control keys.The monitor\u2019s design intent is clearly game-focused.The stand features good ergonomics with 5/23 degrees tilt, 30 degrees swivel and a 130mm height adjustment.They add a distracting level of edge enhancement that only reduces clarity.Overall, the C27G2Z is a solid value among gaming monitors and affords a bit more speed and performance than a 165 Hz display of the same resolution.Today's best AOC C27G2Z deals$199.99ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesWhen shopping for a gaming monitor, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the many specs and features used to market them.Input lag was imperceptible to me and my average skills.Their approximation of HDR is just OK, but since the C27G2Z already has excellent contrast, I didn\u2019t find that they improved the image, only made it look different.Also here is a three-level overdrive which I found too coarse in operation.Accuracy is apparent with or without calibration, as everything looked natural and correct.There are three options that look similar but add different levels of edge enhancement.It also supports FreeSync and G-Sync from 48 to 240 Hz.I would rather have a joystick.Image 1 of 6(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's

whatever one wishes to do.When taken in the context of a budget gaming monitor, the C27G2Z excels.There isn\u2019t any LED lighting, but the trim is bright and creates a good effect.This is a backlight strobe with 20 brightness levels.But with the FHD resolution in use here, frame rates are easy to maintain.For my tests, I calibrated the user color temp using the RGB sliders.If you have the budget for a premium display, you can get everything \u2013 high resolution, high speed, high contrast, high performance, lots of color and the latest bleeding-edge tech.FreeSync works through all three inputs.This menu also has the DP version toggle and volume control.In Game Setting, there are six additional picture modes for different game types.Now that 360 and 500 Hz monitors are available, 240 Hz should be considered a starting point for competitive gaming.This 27-inch VA monitor has a curved screen with a 3,000:1 contrast ratio along with 240 Hz, Adaptive-Sync and wide-gamut color.I couldn\u2019t find a setting free of either black or white ghosting artifacts.The grayscale errors are barely visible in content and gamma tracks very well.AOC has just the ticket with its C27G2Z.One toggles power, and I accidentally turned the monitor off a few times when reaching for the key that activates the OSD.This is my preference for all monitors, especially curved models.Darker settings reduce blur further, but past level 10, the phasing artifact common to this feature becomes too distracting.But the calibrated image is a little better.The only issue I noted with productivity is that at 100% font scaling, you\u2019ll have to scroll a bit more to see websites or to edit long documents.Either way, the deep blacks and saturated color promised by VA technology are fully present here.The feature set is pared down, as expected at this price point.It\u2019s a great way to highlight something like a graphic or part of a gaming environment.The OSD can be moved around the screen if you don\u2019t like its default position at the bottom center.Standard is the default and best mode as it gives users access to all other picture and gaming options.Below are the settings I used for all content.Swipe to scroll horizontallyEco ModeStandard (Game Mode Off)Brightness 200 nits81Brightness 120 nits39Brightness 100 nits28Brightness 80 nits17 (min.The subtle curve adds a slight immersive effect without any noticeable distortion.240 Hz and Adaptive-Sync are the specs of greatest interest.If you want a lighter look, choose 2; darker, choose 3.This menu also has the Adaptive-Sync toggle and a frame rate counter.Doom Eternal was well-detailed with good clarity.If you start combining Eco and Game modes, it\u2019s easy to become lost in the options.If you want the smaller sRGB space, that option is available in the color temp menu.The C27G2Z seems like a decent value, so let\u2019s take a look.Assembly and AccessoriesThe C27G2Z arrives packed in crumbly foam in its three components: base, upright and panel.Since it is priced below 27-inch QHD monitors, it will certainly fill the bill for gamers seeking value.MORE: Best Gaming MonitorsMORE: How We

            "paraphrased_content": "One of those lifelines is switching to renewable energy, and the clock periodically displays the percentage of global energy consumption sourced from renewables like wind and solar energy \u2014 a little under 14 percent today.Today, the planet is about 1.1 degrees Celsius hotter than it was before the Industrial Revolution, thanks to carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels.Every fraction of a degree comes with more severe consequences\n\nThe Climate Clock shows how much time is left before continued CO2 emissions lock in at least 1.5 degrees of global warming, a key threshold for global climate goals under the Paris agreement.\u201cIt is possible to enact the solutions we need in that timeframe and stay below 1.5 degrees.\u201d\n\nThe clock started out as an artsy form of activism.RelatedHeatwaves could trigger energy shortages across two-thirds of North America Heatwaves are stressing out power grids all over the world\n\nThat\u2019s under the assumption that global emissions keep up at a pace similar to 2019 before the covid-19 pandemic caused a temporary drop in pollution as economies slowed down.Energy infrastructure and structural change is not something that you do in a couple of months.Last year was even a record-high year for energy-related CO2 emissions.The Climate Clock\u2019s founders are holding events across five continents today to call attention to the dwindling time left, calling it a Climate Emergency Day.It\u2019s supposed to be a symbol, sort of like the Doomsday Clock meant to serve as \u201ca metaphor for how close humanity is to self-annihilation.\u201d The Climate Clock in Union Square was initially just supposed to be displayed during New York\u2019s Climate Week in 2020, but it has since permanently replaced the 24-hour clock unveiled in 1999 as part of an art installation called Metronome.The world had its hottest week on record at the start of the month, according to preliminary data, with heatwaves still smashing local records across the Northern Hemisphere.It\u2019s something that needs years,\u201d says Sabine Fuss, who leads the working group on sustainable resource management and global change at MCC.\u201cThe best day to have taken action was yesterday.It\u2019s not counting down to the exact date global average temperatures might rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius.That makes every minute count on the Climate Clock.\u201cAction is needed now.In other words, if people keep pumping out roughly the same amount of CO2 pollution over the next five years or so, we\u2019ll no longer be able to limit climate change to just 1.5 degrees of warming.Unfortunately, pollution has picked back up to pre-pandemic levels.\u201cEven if you have marginally more time, it still means that you have to act immediately.\u201dThat\u2019s why world leaders agreed, as part of the landmark Paris agreement, to keep the planet from warming much more than it already has.The display in Union Square also shows key benchmarks for \u201clifelines\u201d that could keep the world on track to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees.It\u2019s called the Climate Clock, and it counts down how much time the world has left to stop climate change from becoming exponentially worse.Instead, it\u2019s estimating how much time is likely left before humans produce enough carbon dioxide pollution to trigger at least 1.5 degrees of warming.An ominous, 62-foot-long clock looms over New York City\u2019s iconic Union Square, and it\u2019s about to tick past a worrying milestone.And that\u2019s just one way\u00a0climate change\u00a0is bringing on dangerous new extremes.Every fraction of a degree comes with more severe consequences.But we\u2019re using [climate] data to create a timeline that is empowering for governments and activists to demand change,\u201d says Becca Richie, global community manager of the Climate Clock organization that grew after the flagship clock was set up in New York City.Today, the time left on the clock falls under six years.It\u2019s what\u2019s driving more intense heatwaves, wildfires, storms, and sea level rise.The clock reflects data from the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC) in Berlin.That includes a vigil below the giant digital clock that has faced Union Square since 2020.As anyone who\u2019s experienced the weather lately knows, the situation is already bad.",

            "paraphrased_content": "You can see your city in a whole new light by going to an overpass or busy intersection in the day when traffic is moving at a good clip and using the 9-second time,\" says de With.\"Another thing I love to do is to make traffic vanish on highways.\"You can swipe anywhere on the screen in Spectre to make the image lighter or darker.\u201cThe reason is actually pretty simple.The Pro version simply unlocks longer exposures (up to thirty seconds) and more.What is long exposure photography?(Image credit: Future)One of the few manual controls in Spectre is 'exposure time' in the app's bottom right-hand corner, which is more a guide to the effect it'll create rather than actual shutter speeds.\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that Spectre\u2019s A.I stabilization is not a magic tripod: you do have to hold your phone steady,\u201d says de With.For the latter, it\u2019s best to have a focal point for the action to move around.\u201cAnd while we can compensate for a lot of movement \u2013 I have taken nice shots on moving boats, bridges that were swaying, windy days and more \u2013 you do have to keep the phone steady.\u201dIf your shots keep turning out blurry, de With has a couple of tips.It\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s super nice when you are fiddling with keeping the phone steady; it saves you poking it with your hands or looking for a slider,\" says de With.This is particularly useful when shooting cities at night, because the intensity of artificial light and hand-shake can easily lead to blown or blurry highlights.But in Spectre Pro, you'll find\u00a0options that include 9-second, 15-second and even 30-second exposures.\u201cWe now offer it on older phones too, that\u2019s why the reviews got a lot better.\u201cYes, we also saw this,\u2019\u201d admitted de With.If you fancy giving it a spin, here are five tips on mastering Spectre from one of the app's co-founders, Sebastiaan de With:Download Spectre for iOSHow to master SpectreSpectre\u2019s computational photo-crunching doesn't mean it's a completely point-and-shoot experience \u2013\u00a0knowing when and how to use the app will massively improve your results.We thought we\u2019d still accommodate users of older iPhones by telling them to use a tripod, but this didn\u2019t really communicate well to users.\u201dThe solution was to figure out a way to help stabilize older iPhones.In the free version of Spectre, this tops out at three seconds \u2013\u00a0long enough to some silky water or creatively blurred moving crowds.\u201cFirst, disable our AI-based scene detection by tapping the lightbulb above and turning \u201coff\u201d light trails.Light trails are used at night and require a much steadier device.\u201dAnd if that doesn\u2019t work, then you\u2019ll need to try the good, old-fashioned approach.Sure, you have to pay for the latter ($4.99 / \u00a34.99 / AU$7.99, to be precise), but the original app and the ability to shoot three-second long exposures is now open to all.For this one, you'll likely need to upgrade to Spectre Pro's longer shutter speeds, but with a practice you can recreate deserted, 28 Days Later-style city scenes.If you fancied adding long exposure photography to your arsenal iPhone camera tricks, now is a good time to do just that \u2013\u00a0the best app for shooting light trails and wispy waterfalls, Spectre, has just been made free.Originally costing $2.99 / \u00a32.99 / AU$4.49, Spectre has now been made into a free download because its maker has introduced a new Spectre Pro tier.\u201cWe went back to work nights and weekends to find a way to add our AI stabilization to older phones, at the expense of image size,\u201d says de With.Here are five good places to start:1) Keep it steady(Image credit: Spectre)Today's phone cameras might be capable of photographic wizardry, but you do still need to lend them a helping hand.\"If you keep the shutter speed lower (for example, three seconds) the people don\u2019t fully \u2018disappear\u2019, and you get the effect of busy crowds blurring or ghostly images,\" he adds.5) Recreate 28 Days Later(Image credit: Spectre)Long exposures are mostly used to introduce motion effects or light trails, but Spectre's extra dash of computational trickery means you can also use it to remove moving subjects entirely.Typically, both cameras and apps have created the long exposure effect by using long shutter speeds of several seconds.But Spectre naturally uses AI tricks to turn the effect into a point-and-shoot experience.Mastering the app involves a little trial-and-error \u2013\u00a0in particular, with recognizing which scenes will actually benefit from 'dragging' the shutter, as long exposures are suited to particular scenes (think night-time traffic, scenes with moving water, or busy shots where you want to remove people or other moving subjects).Lessons were learned.\u201dSpectre's stabilization works on iPhones going back as the iPhone 7, 6S and SE, but you do need to be running iOS 15.\u201cIf shots keep coming out blurry, it might require you to stabilize your iPhone by putting it on something like a table or a ledge when it takes the photo.\u201d2) Use the exposure slider(Image credit: Spectre)While its interface might be a bit too simplistic for some, Spectre benefits from many of the neat design touches seen in its sister app, Halide, which we still think is one of the best camera apps around.One of these is the exposure slider, which is available anywhere in the app rather in a fixed control.Taking so many photos is very hard on older iPhones.But fortunately, back when Spectre won Apple's App of the Year in 2019, we spoke to Sebastiaan de With (co-founder of Spectre and its sister app Halide) to get some insider tips on how best to use the long exposure app and get some good results from it on your travels.How Spectre works(Image credit: Spectre)How does Spectre differ from traditional long exposure apps and camera techniques?- and then take a photo of people moving around them,\" says de With.Early users of Spectre back in 2019 found that their results were often blurry, and the app\u2019s initial App Store reviews weren\u2019t exactly glowing.Scroll through the frame then choose 'Make Key Photo'.4) Start ghosting people(Image credit: Spectre)The three main long exposure effects you can create with Spectre are silky water, light trails and blurring moving people in busy scenes.When using a DSLR or mirrorless camera, shooting long exposures usually involves tripods, ND (neutral density) filters to avoid over-exposure, and a whole lot of experimentation and patience.It's a technique used by photographers who want to add some additional drama or atmosphere to a scene by opening up the shutter and allowing movement to become blurred.To make traffic or people disappear, make sure the light trails options (in the top left-hand corner) is switched off, too.\u201cThe resulting image is a composite of all those photos we take,\" says de With.\"And since we save it as a Live Photo, you even get a little video of the exposure as it happens.\u201d(Image credit: Spectre)But it isn't quite as simple as that.\u201cSince it\u2019s a Live Photo, you can often tap \u2018Edit\u2019 in Photos, go back to the last Live Photo frame that was sharp, and save it as that.\u201dTo do this, press the 'edit' button in the top-right corner of the Photos app, then press the Live Photos symbol (concentric circles) on the left.Hence the need for a tripod or ND filter to prevent camera shake and overexposure when shooting in daylight.But Spectre employs a computational technique that\u2019s similar to the likes of Apple's Smart HDR to help overcome your iPhone's physical limitations, like its small sensor size and limited shutter speeds.3) Go LiveAnother benefit of Spectre\u2019s computational approach, compared to a traditional long exposure, is that you have more than one frame to choose from.\u201cAsk someone to stand still in a crowded place - very still!It's no longer unique in doing this \u2013 alternative apps like Even Longer and ReeHeld use similar techniques \u2013 but we've still generally got the best results from Spectre.As Sebastiaan de With explained to us: \u201cPhones can\u2019t actually take photos for five seconds, so we thought we\u2019d \u2018cheat\u2019 a bit: we take hundreds of fast photos, which are also sharper, and then blend them together with some AI that compensates for the natural movement in your hand and arm.\u201dLike many HDR modes, you then get a mix of all these snaps.If you're finding this, try bringing the exposure down by sliding your thumb down the screen.So if you\u2019re still having issues with image blur, then using the Live Photo is an option.",

            "paraphrased_content": "It's not that easy, only because it remains unclear whether Sennheiser plans on making the trial scheme a global affair \u2013 and how much it might cost.Simply put, these little blue lozenges make some of the best wired earbuds I've ever worn even better.Arguably my favorite wired earbuds at the moment are the superlative Campfire Audio Solaris Stellar Horizon, and it's those levels of detail, clarity, agility and insight I'm now getting from some much cheaper Sennheisers.I cast aside my trusty Comply memory foam small ear tips and quickly pop the Custom Comfort Tips over the nozzle.\"This simple Sony Xperia, Sennheiser and ear tip setup provides oodles of extra detail and insight (Image credit: Future)The audiophile in me simply shakes these jibes off.They're just that good.and my personal favorite: \"Ah, you accidentally dipped them in sealing wax when sending one of your letters.How do you sign up for your own set?I actually think they're quite beautiful (Image credit: Future)Zoe Wees' textured vocal in Girls Like Us brims with singularity and angst through her juicier alto registers.Having your name etched on earbuds is fine, right?Physical drop-outs happen often with my old EarPods (a cheap option, but one I still think beats any of Apple's AirPods), but they certainly don't occur with my new pricier Sennheiser setup and my Custom Comfort Tips.No, no.I'll get straight to it: if you've been following my quest to jump aboard Sennheiser's trial custom ear tip scheme (which involved a wild trip to High End Munich to get my auricles 3D mapped inside and out)\u00a0and have been wondering whether it was all worth it, I have the answer, in three words: yes, yes\u2026 yes!You won't lose one earbud to a puddle in the way you can with a wire-free design, but no matter how snag-resistant the cables, and how easily the ear-hooks snake around your biological listening gear, you will pull one on a button or sleeve at some point.Across the board.And it's all thanks to the company's unique Sennheiser-specific ear tip pilot scheme.You see, despite my beloved wires offering better security as well as superior analog audio quality, they do present a challenge.Also, because these are wired earbuds, there's no moulded battery nest for my kit to no longer fit into.And that leads me to another reason everybody should get these Custom Comfort Tips if Sennheiser does the decent thing and rolls the trial out globally: wired earbuds differ from the best wireless earbuds in many ways.I've patiently waited a month for my excellent little ear bits to arrive \u2013 and nobody will even see them once they're in my shell-likes anyway.As you'd expect, the ear tips have a little red dot on them to denote the right tip, which corresponds with the thin red halo on the driver housing of my IE 600s.Squashed Bic pen?(Image credit: Future)The IEMs I'm using are the Sennheiser IE 600, aka the in-ear monitors that sit just below the firm's flagship IE 900 proposition, but Sennheiser's Custom Comfort Tip trial scheme earpieces will work on the company's IE 200, Sennheiser IE 300,\u00a0IE 600 or\u00a0Sennheiser IE 900 audiophile-grade, TechRadar-recommended wired earbuds.Until then, you'll find me with my IE 600s hooked up to my Sony Xperia 1 IV, seeing what this simple audiophile system can do with Qobuz's best new hi-res playlists.I call it my happy place \u2013 I hope you also find yours this weekend.And if your earpieces don't fit properly, they might fall out.It stands to reason that achieving a near-perfect seal betwixt the external hardware and your own skin and cartilage will level up the talents of your headphones, and yet it's still quite special when you hear it for yourself.Sennheiser's best, but betterNobody even sees their beautiful blue hue \u2013 almost seems a shame (Image credit: Future)Having researched Avery's solution to fix my AirPods' poor fit, I've tried UE's excellent heat-to-fit earbuds proposition (called the UE Drops if you're looking for a true wireless option) and my search for the best earbuds for small ears is an ongoing battle that's currently being won by Sony's beautiful bijou LinkBuds S.\u00a0But nothing I've tried to date has equalled this level of security, comfort and audio fidelity.Today's best Sennheiser IE600, Sennheiser

\u2013 it's worth noting that you'll need to take a moment to carefully extract them from your ears after a listening session.I will reach out to Sennheiser and let you know of any updates.Once they're mounted on their respective units, a lovely little representation of what Sennheiser's audiologists called my \"really short\" ear canals on both sides is revealed.Other visual cues suggested by my colleagues at this point include, \"I think someone stuck chewing gum on your earbuds\", \"Is that the end of a chewed Bic pen?\"The driving beat in Sam Smith's Barbiecore dance romp, Man I Am, feels like it grazes the underside of my brain before chimes greet my left ear and Smith's vocal bursts through the middle.And I'm not just quoting When Harry Met Sally because it turns out that my asking for \"Chelsea blue with my name etched on, please\" during said appointment in Germany resulted in a set of tips that could, according to various sources, be mistaken for Viagra pills in low light.Easy.Honestly, hi-res audio is just the tip of the iceberg.",

            "paraphrased_content": "FDA-approved heart-rate monitoring(Image credit: Basil Kronfli / TechRadar)News from Samsung itself suggests that this is coming to the Galaxy Watch 6, and in many ways it feels about time.Still, the durable digital timepiece still earned 4 stars.The Korean manufacturer's efforts just get better and better, and we\u2019re naturally intrigued to see what\u2019s coming with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.We\u2019d prefer a streamlined list of options if it means each one gets meaningful care and attention, like running, cycling., skiing and swimming.There's a clear disconnect here.Samsung\u2019s ECG (electrocardiogram) isn\u2019t new tech, but its Irregular Heart Rhythm Notification functionality hadn\u2019t been FDA-approved until May of this year.Samsung said in a press release that \u201cthe upcoming Galaxy Watch devices later this year, as part of the new One UI 5 Watch and later expanded to previous editions.\u201d We\u2019re expecting it to roll out to some prior models (the Galaxy Watch 4 onward) once One UI 5, Samsung\u2019s version of Wear OS 4, is up and running on those older models.A bigger battery in Galaxy Watch 6 Classic(Image credit: Basil Kronfli / TechRadar)One of our main grips with the fifth edition of the Galaxy Watch was its one-day battery life, meaning it made it tough to recommend for sleep tracking since you\u2019d need to charge it daily (often overnight).Reports suggest that the Galaxy Watch 6 will come in a \u2018Classic\u2019 variant with a 47mm display - the largest Galaxy Watch yet.It\u2019s got great sleep tracking credentials with the ability to assign a chronotype, or \u2018sleep animal\u2019, and coach you to better sleep hygiene habits.However, it\u2019s likely to make its official debut with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.The technology uses the BioActive Sensor in the background of everyday usage, scanning for irregular heart rates which can be caused by underlying health conditions like bradycardia.Nevertheless, someone needs to give it some thought soon, and if Samsung can crack the indoor-workout riddle, they'll be leaps and bounds ahead of even the best Apple Watches in the workout stakes.In our review of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5, we noted that it felt like the company had hit a little bit of a ceiling, though, saying it felt like an incremental upgrade.Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Watch 5 has consistently been one of our favourite Android smartwatches, taking the battle to Apple Watch with an excellent array of apps and more and more new features each time.It\u2019s top of our list of the best smartwatches for Android users in terms of value and functionality.We certainly have a good idea of what to expect based on leaks, but we\u2019re clutching our wishlist in hand all the same.Here\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting to see from the 2023 smartwatch when it (probably) launches during Samsung Galaxy Unpacked next week, and one thing we hope it avoids.\u00a01.Today's best Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 and  Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro deals\u00a3256.64\u00a3223.89View\u00a3239View\u00a3289\u00a3239ViewShow More DealsWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesBetter sleep tracking(Image credit: Future / Basil Kronfli)Speaking of, going hand-in-hand with better battery life, the Galaxy Watch 6 is expected to improve its already stellar sleep tracking and assist in finding balanced sleep.A new Sleep Insights dashboard is said to collate data from snoring, blood oxygen levels, and the phases of sleep, while offering Sleep Coaching to help users understand the data presented: all directly on the watch rather than in the app as it currently is.The Watches are also said to work more harmoniously with your smart home, dimming lights and helping play ambient sounds.Perfect for setting up the ideal environment for snoozing.What we don\u2019t want to see: Superfluous workout modesThis may be a little like \u201cOld Man yells at clouds\u201d, and it\u2019s definitely not strictly a Samsung issue, but we\u2019d like manufacturers to be more conscious of the workout modes included in their exercise apps.Aside from running, cycling, and swimming, it\u2019s tough to track metrics for other sports and disciplines outside of the more catch-all metrics of heart rate, calories, and workout duration.That trifecta at least has additional data points that can be collected, like speed, power, and stroke detection respectively, but do we really need such a cluttered list of workout options when so many of them boil down to guesswork?That\u2019s only 2mm more than the largest version we have now, but the real change could be under the hood.A larger version would, theoretically, allow for a bigger chassis and more room for a larger battery - something we felt the Galaxy Watch 5 could really have used last time around.That\u2019s going to make its existing blood pressure monitoring, body composition, and heart rate monitoring tech all the more useful, and Samsung makes a strong case for being the most advanced health watch on the market from a heart rate standpoint.\u00a02.However, the need for almost-daily charging means too often those capabilities go unused.GPS functionality is great on the Watch 5 and the Watch 5 Pro, but again, it drains the battery, so long events like triathlons need to be timed very well.After all, how does a watch successfully measure a yoga class, or a strength session?A bigger battery, and improved power efficiency, could change things and make it a preferable buy over one of the best Garmin watches for Samsung phone users.\u00a03.",
