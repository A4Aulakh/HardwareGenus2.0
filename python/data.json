            "paraphrased_content": "There are two key things to remember.You must complete the daily Quordle before midnight in your timezone.What is a good Quordle strategy?Quordle needs to be approached in a different way to Wordle.7.But after that, you should select another word or possibly two that use up lots more of the most common consonants and that include any remaining vowels.Each guess must be a valid word in Quordle's dictionary.Quordle today (game #564) - hint #1 - VowelsHow many different vowels are in Quordle today?\u2022 The number of different vowels in Quordle today is 3*.Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green.But Quordle is tough, so if you already find yourself searching for Wordle hints, you'll probably need some for this game too.Use several starting words\nFirstly, you won't want just a single starting word, but almost certainly two or three starting words.It's time for your daily dose of Quordle hints, plus the answers for both the main game and the Daily Sequence spin off.Read on for my Quordle hints to game #564 and the answers to the main game and Daily Sequence.8.So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green.In the scenario above, CLAMP would be a great guess, as it could point the way to four of the seven words in one go.It's played online via the Quordle website and you can also get to it via the Merriam-Webster site, after the dictionary purchased Quordle last year.6. Letters can appear more than once.- and there are daily stats including a streak count.You have nine guesses to find the Quordle answers.Yes, he takes it all too seriously.Narrow things down\nSecondly, if you're faced with a word where the answer might easily be one of several options - for instance -ATCH, where it could be MATCH, BATCH, LATCH, CATCH, WATCH, HATCH or PATCH - you'll definitely want to guess a word that would narrow down those options.Quordle today (game #564) - hint #2 - total vowelsWhat is the total number of vowels in Quordle today?\u2022 The total number of vowels across today's Quordle answers is 7.Quordle today (game #564) - hint #3 - repeated lettersDo any of today's Quordle answers contain repeated letters?\u2022 The number of Quordle answers containing a repeated letter today is 1.Quordle today (game #564) - hint #4 - total lettersHow many different letters are used in Quordle today?\u2022 The total number of different letters used in Quordle today is 13.Quordle today (game #564) - hint #5 - uncommon lettersDo the letters Q, Z, X or J appear in Quordle today?\u2022 Yes.And also as with Wordle, the puzzle resets at midnight so you have a fresh challenge each day.But in Quordle, this will almost certainly result in a failure - you simply don't have enough guesses.That's the case in Wordle too, of course, but it's even more important in Quordle.Answers are never plural.There are plenty of other options - you might want to get an M, B, F or G in there instead of the H, maybe - but something like that should do the trick.Between them, these three words use 15 of the 26 letters in the alphabet including all five vowels, Y, and nine of the most common consonants (S, T, R, D, L, P, N, C and H).You get nine guesses, rather than the six for Wordle, but the rules are otherwise very similar.If not, well good luck!\u2026BUT the word you guess appears in all quadrants of the puzzle at the same time, so an A could turn green in one square, yellow in another and gray in the final two.Really difficult.What are the Quordle rules?The rules of Quordle are almost identical to those of Wordle.1.I'm a Quordle and Wordle fanatic who's been playing since December 2021, so I can definitely help you solve Quordle today and improve your game for tomorrow.You can't guess ABCDE, for instance.For instance, I currently use STARE > DOILY > PUNCH.He's authored dozens of articles on the game for TechRadar and its sister site Tom's Guide, including a detailed analysis of the most common letters in every position.If all goes well, that will give you a good lead on what one or sometimes two of the answers might be.His Wordle streak recently reached the 500 mark and he'll be inconsolable if he loses it.* Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too).Quordle is the only one of the many Wordle clones that I'm still playing now, around 18 months after the daily-word-game craze hit the internet, and with good reason: it's good fun, but also difficult.What's more, its makers (now the online dictionary Merriam-Webster) are also keeping it fresh in the form of a new variant called the Daily Sequence, which sees you complete four puzzles consecutively, rather than concurrently.If you're not ready yet then here's one more clue to make things a lot easier:Quordle today (game #564) -

Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow.The first of these should probably be one of the best Wordle starting words, because the same things that make them work well will apply here too.With four puzzles to solve in nine guesses, you can't blindly throw letters at it and expect to win - you'll stand a far better chance if you think strategically.You also get Quordle Achievements - specific badges for winning a game in a certain number of turns, playing lots of times, or guessing particularly hard words.Plus, it's the only option in Hard mode.SPOILER WARNING: Information about Quordle today is below, so don't read on if you don't want to know the answers.Your Quordle expertYour Quordle expertMarc McLarenSocial Links NavigationUK Editor in ChiefMarc is TechRadar\u2019s UK Editor in Chief and has been playing Wordle and Quordle for more than a year.",

            "paraphrased_content": "She writes that Dell saw it as an opportunity to \u201cfurther differentiate Alienware from its competitors.\u201d\n\nDough claims it will offer a two-year burn-in warranty, too.I would still argue that two or even three years of burn-in protection isn\u2019t necessarily enough for a device you could easily use for a decade \u2014 but going from a zero-year guarantee to a two-year one is a big move for LG.RelatedLG\u2019s 27-inch OLED is ushering in a new age for monitors\n\nBut after four months of conversations with The Verge, LG Electronics has changed that warranty.Technically, it says LG will only cover \u201cnormal and proper use\u201d and specifically excludes \u201cDamage or failure of the Product resulting from misuse [or] abuse.\u201d\n\nBut LG Electronics product marketing director David Park makes it pretty clear: \u201cNow, as long as you use the monitor as intended (personal PC monitor) in a residential setting (does not support commercial usage like retail signage display) burn-in is covered.\u201d\n\n\u201cNormal use means the product is used for what it was created to do.Asus gaming PR lead Cat Tompkins said the company would need to talk to LG about its burn-in warranty before providing an official statement for this story.For years, OLED enthusiasts and monitor manufacturers have warned that you shouldn\u2019t leave the same content on the screen for too long, some even going so far as to hide the Windows taskbar and browser chrome to avoid burn-in.Alienware currently offers large curved ultrawide QD-OLED screens from Samsung.Corsair uses the same LG Display screen, while Alienware uses a Samsung QD-OLED panel.In my recent review of LG\u2019s 27-inch OLED desktop gaming monitor, I wrote how the company\u2019s warranty explicitly excludes \u201cburned-in images resulting from improper usage.\u201d And when I reached out to clarify, I couldn\u2019t get a straight answer about burn-in coverage from the company.OLED might be the future of monitors, but first, they need to finish addressing burn-in fears.LG now has a two-year burn-in warranty for its OLED gaming monitor in the US, Christopher De Maria, LG\u2019s head of consumer PR for North America, tells The Verge.So confident that they offer a burn-in warranty to monitor manufacturers \u2014 some of which don\u2019t pass along that warranty to you.But LG Display and Samsung Display, the companies that make the OLED panels inside these monitors, now have so many built-in protections and manage their brightness so much that they\u2019re confident they can stave off burn-in for quite some time.Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge\n\n\u201cOur warranty is built around the fact that we trust in that pixel refresh function to help mitigate burn-in,\u201d says Alienware PR specialist Frank Cestone.After we pointed that out to LG Electronics and published our skeptical but largely favorable review, the company finally confirmed it will cover burn-in.\u201cDiscretion\u201d is not a guarantee\n\n\u201cWhile burn-in is not considered part of our formal 3-year monitor warranty coverage, in practice, our customer care team has discretion to assist customers with this rare issue and authorize repair services, free-of-charge,\u201d says Acer media relations manager Erin Davern.The new warranty, which De Maria says also applies retroactively to any LG 27GR95QE-B monitors that have already been sold, doesn\u2019t exactly spell it out that way.Page 2 of  LG Gaming OLED Monitor Warranty\n\n\n\n    Contributed to DocumentCloud by The Verge (Vox.com) \u2022 View document or read text\n\nThat\u2019s important because companies will often take evidence of damage as evidence of abuse, like how some companies will deny warranty service on water-resistant phones if any water penetrates inside.Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge\n\nAcer and Asus, which also sell monitors with the same LG Display panel, still don\u2019t cover burn-in.In this case that is gaming (professional and casual) as well as desktop computing such as Windows, etc,\u201d De Maria tells The Verge.Neither answered our question about why they don\u2019t pass along LG Display\u2019s burn-in warranty to their own customers, with the Acer Predator X27U and the Asus ROG Swift\u00a0OLED\u00a0PG27AQDM.Another image of LG\u2019s 27-inch gaming OLED.\u201cWhen QD-OLED technology was introduced, we knew there was an opportunity to address the broader concerns around OLED reliability,\u201d Dell VP of display technologies Yoon Lee tells The Verge.Dell\u2019s Alienware and Corsair both sell OLED monitors with three-year burn-in warranties, and Alienware even offers next-business-day replacement.",

            "paraphrased_content": "The more mileage you can get out of one strap, the less you need in your collection, and you\u2019d have less of a need to swap them out for specific occasions.The last thing I want is to add more steps before I can head out the door.This is specific to me, but I\u2019ve already got to slather on sunscreen, stick in my contact lenses, get my water bottle, and sync up at least three other wearables for testing.My dream strap would be some kind of leather up top, with a more breathable nylon or fabric underside.There are tools you can buy to make the process easier, but then you\u2019ve also got to dig out the tools whenever you feel like switching up your style.It\u2019s more of a Slimer, ectoplasm-y green.You can find much more affordable alternatives on Amazon or Etsy, but having to replace any part of a collection is an annoying prospect, regardless of cost.Straps that use standard pins are convenient in that many smartwatches and mechanical watches use them.I\u2019ve got bad eyes and a penchant for manicures.It\u2019d be neat, if like Nomad\u2019s glow-in-the-dark strap, you could have one that changes color depending on the light or body temperature \u2014 sort of like a mood ring.The \u201cminimal effort\u201d part is key.Smartwatch makers have gotten better about this over time, but sometimes straps aren\u2019t backward- or forward-compatible.At the very least, multifunctional bands would let you save time and money, without sacrificing style for folks who may lack hand dexterity.Oftentimes, your existing straps may not work, and then you have a useless collection.I\u2019m well aware this won\u2019t appeal to everyone.Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeButton mechanisms are much easier to use than standard pins, but I still broke my weak nails using this.Plenty of people like having a healthy strap collection, while others are happy to never switch from the default strap.At $60, Nomad\u2019s strap is expensive, and if it didn\u2019t feel like two straps in one, I\u2019d balk at the idea of buying one in the first place \u2014 let alone having to toss it if it didn't work with my next Apple Watch.Watches \u2014 smart or otherwise \u2014 are a fashion statement, people have different needs from their wearables, and everybody\u2019s skin reacts differently to certain materials.Button-based mechanisms \u2014 like Apple\u2019s and Samsung\u2019s new one-click straps\u2014 are less cumbersome but can still be difficult if you have limited hand mobility.If it\u2019s the look that you\u2019re going for, it can pass both up close and from a distance.Depending on how well the strap is made or the size of the mechanism itself, it can be a hassle to swap one strap for another.I\u2019ve broken many a nail and chipped one too many manicures in the process.In most cases, it\u2019s not difficult to swap out straps.But sometimes, it can be!But after trying out Nomad\u2019s new glow-in-the-dark Apple Watch strap and Samsung\u2019s hybrid eco-leather strap this week, I find myself yearning for straps that serve multiple purposes.Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge\n\nIn both cases, it\u2019s similar to the \u201cday-to-night\u201d concept \u2014\u00a0an outfit or makeup look that\u2019s easily adaptable from one scenario to another with minimal effort on the part of the wearer.This hybrid strap has eco-leather up top and more traditional fluoroelastomer rubber on the underside.RelatedApple Watch Ultra strap review: choose your fighter How to swap Pixel Watch bands\n\nA more practical example would be the eco-leather strap that comes as the default on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.In the dark, it turns day-glo green.In normal lighting, all you see is a normal cream-colored strap.It\u2019s the definition of business during the day, party at night.The hybrid aspect is that the underside of the strap is silicone.I\u2019m a huge fan of this kind of strap because I don\u2019t have to swap straps before a workout.I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s not the most practical strap \u2014 it\u2019s a subtler glow in person, but it\u2019s probably not the best pick if I were to go to a theater.Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeButton mechanisms are much easier to use than standard pins, but I still broke my weak nails using this.Nomad\u2019s strap

rubber on the underside.Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe other issue is managing your strap collection.But the thing that spoke to me is it lets me switch up my style with next to no effort.Or, say you decide you want to go up or down a size within the same watch family.If every strap you buy can work in multiple scenarios, you don\u2019t need as many straps to begin with.The easiest way to ensure you stick to an exercise regimen is to eliminate as much friction as you can from the process \u2014 and it\u2019s a big reason why I don\u2019t opt for leather straps in my day-to-day despite preferring the look.Never mind that eco-leather isn\u2019t always real leather.It\u2019s no surprise that most fitness trackers have swappable straps these days.(Silicone is nice, but my skin often breaks out in rashes from the contact; that never happens with fabric.)Considering how many knockoff leather hybrid straps there are and the fact Nomad\u2019s glow-in-the-dark strap sold out in 24 hours, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one who digs the idea.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Those classes are more powerful, for sure, and that gear is unobtainable otherwise.It is important to remark that on NG Plus, the Vestige system is different.Yeah.Say the main player dies and is locked into Umbral; how does that affect the other player they're cooperating with?Does increasing your radiance have an impact on what you see within the world and environments as well?Is the Dark Crusade\u00a0still part of the story here, or have you guys abandoned that to go create something completely different with this Lord of the Fallen?This is a bit too far.Looking back at From Software's Bloodborne, with that game, as you acquired insight and you accumulated that, you got to see a few more of the layers of the world peel back, revealing the full extent of the cosmic horror influence and a lot of those creatures and horrors.You are not disconnected from the game or waiting in limbo but can actually see what's happening.We expect most players to follow the canon path, but we also anticipate more expert users or even speedrunners to bend the rules and take those side paths.Adyr is coming back, and that's where the Dark Crusaders come in.In the regular game, you have more Vestiges to help you out, but on NG Plus, you will not have them.Saul Galscon: On both consoles, we offer performance and quality modes.If their bosses, like the Orian Church's version of the Vatican, found out what he's doing, they wouldn't be too happy.The performance mode goes at 60 frames per second and 1080p resolution upscaled, which is kind of the standard in the industry.Saul Galscon: In terms of the mythos, you have the Hallowed Sentinels, which are the Orian followers.Anyway, this is pretty much our setup.It's more hardcore.They come from the first game's mythos.On top of this, there are other changes to the core gameplay that move the game more toward the original vision.This can't be limbo.They're the only ones who have the red glove that allows them to do whatever they need to accomplish Orian's will.It's really up to you.So if you wanna achieve different endings and see more of the NPCs' journeys, you will need several playthroughs, also to unlock the three unique classes that we have, which have their own loadout, gear, unique items, and spells.But then you can play a bit with it and access different places.You've also been featured on Epic's State of Unreal stream.What we did in our Lords of the Fallen is to establish that those guys failed their purpose.The host can touch your body to get you back.But we pave a path that is the canon one.Cezar Virtosu: Doing quests and interacting with the NPC and the evil entities that will ask you to do things will put you on a collision course with a lot of the content and quests.Is this something real, or is it a parallel universe?Whenever it was production ready, we just swapped the whole thing to UE5.But yes, they can rush.But they failed.Epic is super supportive, they're great.Saul Galscon: No, they only have one.Can you share the target resolution and frame rate set for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X versions?It's too organic.Saul Galscon: Yes.The quality mode is 2K upscaled at 30 FPS.So you start fresh and you can make different decisions on your second or third playthrough.It's fine-looking equipment because those classes are powerful, even if you start from zero.They would be like, 'Yes, sir!'Do players have the freedom to go with whichever of the five they want to start with?We put it in the game even, adding some lines that they wrote as a description of an item.Working with Unreal Engine 5 has been a pleasure.It'll be just that one, so it's kind of the original vision.You will understand its nature because when you raise your lamp, you see that world of shadow and corruption made manifest and all the eyes looking at you and the eye that looks into the UI.You guys have the seamless online co-op in Lords of the Fallen.Can you talk about the technical side of Lords of the Fallen?We're already seeing hooks that one of the goals that we're seeing so far is acquiring the five beacons.It has a cost in time.Saul Galscon: The host always drives which realm you are in.Will there be different endings?Cezar Virtosu: Let me add something.If the NPC is a vendor, both of the players can interact with vendors.We've seen some players lurking and waiting for the host to die, and you know how it is.With Lumen, all this process is now in real-time, so it was the most impactful UE5 feature for us.Will there be a new game plus mode where if you finish the game with one ending, you can start again retaining the power of character and be able to work towards the other two endings.UE5 is a huge leap in terms of tech, and it's gonna get even better.After the session was over, we had the chance to speak with Creative Director Cezar Virtosu and Executive Producer (as well as Head of Studio of developer Hexworks) Saul Gascon to discuss many aspects of Lords of the Fallen.Why are people dying and some of them get trapped here?But it was directed by CI Games, which is the mother company.I mean, they're the best in the world, from our point of view.Cezar Virtosu: Unfortunately, no.Intriguing.This applies to PvP and can actually lead to funny moments.We would have loved to take things as far as that.Saul Galscon: If you start a game, you get to this bridge where a vendor sells you one of the keys to access one of the endgame levels.But even if you play at 60, Lords of the Fallen looks\u00a0really good.If you start just a regular new game, you still have that class unlocked by virtue of having done that quest or finished that ending.But unfortunately, increasing your stat only provides scholarly insight into the items and tools.We've tried a lot of iterations and the clearest method for all players based on our playtest was to set it up this way.As a reminder, the game will be released on October 13th for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.Cezar Virtosu: One of them decided to use the lamp.Related StoryKai TatsumotoLords of the Fallen (2023) Hands-On Preview \u2013 Same Name, Familiar GameThere's been a couple of studios that have worked on a new Lords of the Fallen game before Hexworks.But the guest cannot interact with an NPC to select quest answers during dialogues.I was about to ask if the key items, say any of the Sanguinar's upgrades, can be carried into your own game after you've unlocked them as a guest.Every time you do an NG plus run, the world forgets about your previous choices, right?The other thing I want to touch on is your usage of Unreal Engine 5.So in the bowels of Lords of the Fallen, in the deepest recesses, if you follow a quest, you will get to the heart of it all, stare into the abyss, and realize that Umbral is not what you thought it would be.You won't see those specific key items if you already got them, but everything you see, you can pick up.Also, when you play, you find areas that are a bit harder and can either avoid them or attempt to go on anyway.Cezar Virtosu: Yes.In the original design, we only had one Vestige which is in the sky bridge, and everything else was your own crafted vestiges.We expanded on those concepts, including the Orian Church and its war against Adyr, the god that ruled humanity.Lords of the Fallen is semi-linear, but certain areas are effectively behind a paywall, which means if you got enough resources, you could skip and go directly to the horror area.Whenever we came back to the designers or the artists and asked 'Hey, can you move that window just a bit to the right, so the light focuses on this corner?Saul Galscon: We started from scratch.Saul Gascon: I think we took the foundations from work done by Deck13 on the original Lords of the Fallen.People coming in expecting to play more Lords of the Fallen instead of the high fantasy, somewhat medieval game would find this cosmic horror, dark fantasy, more realistic experience.As far as the freedom for the player goes, there was a conversation about the game being semi-linear.We support basically everything that you could expect in that regard.The host cannot just tap and keep running, he needs to spend some time resuscitating the other player.We want the players to wonder: 'What is this?Share this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n TwitterSaul Galscon: We support FSR.How does that play out?As part of a recent Lords of the Fallen event organized by publisher CI Games, Wccftech was invited to go hands-on with the upcoming Soulslike title; you may check out the preview article here.And then, from there, we started from scratch, basically.How much of the original framework from the prior studios carried forth into what Hexworks is building on?We always made sure that the game was compatible, right?When you unlock one of those classes, can you start a new game immediately as one of those new classes?Playing NG Plus allows you to make different choices, but the way you approach the game is also different.I was curious if the radiance stack does something similar, because I'm already noticing that as you increase that you see more of the tooltips on the items and get more insight into the world.The host has two lives, so if you get invaded in Axiom, you have an advantage because the invader needs to kill you twice.We have grown that story 1000 years later, adding much more to it to the point where it felt like its own creature.Saul Galscon: When we started the project, Unreal Engine 5 was not available back then.Cezar Virtosu: They've been very supportive because we were one of the first triple-A studios to adopt it right from the beginning.Two of them are behind very arcane quests, and they all come with the new classes unlocked and new abilities.Cezar Virtosu: Yes, but if they're unique items, like the Sanguinar's upgrades, you can't get them both from your world and a friend's world.The Orian Church send their medieval James Bonds, which is the Dark Crusaders, who can even use heretical\u00a0means that would be considered capital sins for everyone.Thank you for your time.Cezar Virtosu: That's gear that is unique to that particular class, and it's very good gear.Anyway, you need to know that Deck13 worked on the original project, right?On the other hand, when the client dies, he goes into a spectator mode.There is a big platform in Umbral where if you see the PvP player coming to you and he's on the platform, you can touch one of the effigies and he'll fall into the abyss.If you and I are playing together and you die, you being the host, then we will both be transported to Umbral.What happens with the souls?Are there any items or upgrades that are unique to New Game Plus?In this case, it's stopping Adyr's return.With PvP, if you're both in the Axiom realm, does the invading player also have two lives?When we're in Axiom, I can use my Umbral lamp and abilities, but I can never bring us both to Umbral.They were supposed not to allow Adyr to come back.The host always directs the realm you are in.Now there's a new god that rules humanity; what happens and what is with these Umbral horror times?Nanite is also great because you get a bump of quality everywhere.We made them actual NPCs in the world, and we wrapped up the story that they had conceived and figured out what happens 1000 years later.So, we have all the information, but we started from a blank slate.But we always had a branch with whatever UE5 pre-launch builds were available.As Saul said, in terms of characters and story events, we took everything that Deck13 did.Why am I doing that?'Cezar Virtosu: No, not entirely.But if you dig into Umbral enough, you will access the heart of it.We kind of made a big kill list of what people liked and what people did not like, the dos and don'ts, right?We just tweaked a couple of things here and there, and then we made it work.You can buy it, though it's a bit expensive when you start, but you can grind for some time, buy it and yes, access that endgame level.We took that, and we went through all the feedback from players, right through Reddit and the Steam community, as well as from reviewers of printed magazines, online magazines, and also YouTube reviews and streamers.Going back on the cosmic horror that you just mentioned.Cezar Virtosu: Yes, we have three endings.Of course, he will keep any items obtained.Cezar Virtosu: The Dark Crusade concept came from our own desire and take on the story.On top of those two, there are other elements, like the Chaos physics, which really helps with all the clothes, and a lot of improvements on animation pipelines that allowed us to make movement more fluid for both enemies and player characters.What is this manifestation?We were keen to jump on the Unreal Engine.The most powerful and, let's say, game-changing technology was Lumen because it allowed us to forego lightmaps, the old-school way to light environments.They would move it, then click render with the towers, and then maybe we went, 'Oh, sorry, I meant three meters, not two'.We moved away from that design because we didn't want the guest to advance the host's world of the host.When you play Lords of the Fallen in co-op, the host interacts with the NPCs, and the guest listens.When the guest comes back to his own world, it did not progress.The invaders will always have the upper hand by virtue of hiding.They're annoying enough that way!Cezar Virtosu: Was your question aimed at the other Lords of the Fallen 2 iterations that were announced previously?They can use the Umbral lamp, which is completely forsaken and forbidden even to talk about, but these guys can use it.",

2023That impressive battery might be due, in part, to the new Exynos W930 chipset, which might be doing some better power management, even with the giant always-on display.On the curved back are sensors to track your heart, ECG, and temperature.More on this in my software section.Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic new band attachment system (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)Samsung redesigned the watch band release and now uses an on-band button to retract the pins so you can pull off the band.It also has a barometer, gyroscope, and light sensor.This bold, big-faced WearOS smartwatch is as adept at delivering you the time, weather, and alerts as it is tracking your activities, workouts, and overall health in a way few wearables have attempted before.This is a statement watch that offers a massive 37.3mm screen and the return of the rotatable bezel.(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)When it works, though, you get some fascinating insights.Otherwise, you can choose from among the Galaxy Watch 6's 40 and 43mm sizes (even the smaller 43mm Classic) and spend less and have something lighter, smaller, and less obtrusive on your wrist.The first time, the battery still seemed to be adjusting and it ran out of power before morning.Oddly, it also said I hadn't snored at all.It'll be hard to find a better really-big WearOS smartwatch than this one.Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic: SpecificationsSwipe to scroll horizontallyComponentSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (43mm)Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (47mm)Dimensions42.5 x

availability(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic debuted during Samsung Unpacked on July 26, alongside the Watch 6, the Tab S9 series, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 phones.In the US, we have prices for the Bluetooth-only Watch 6 Classic models, which costs $399.99 for the 43mm model, and $429.99 for the 47mm model.This is so it can send a low-power electrical current through your body to measure your bone, fat and muscle mass, just like one of the best smart scales.the smaller 40mm Galaxy Watch 6 weighs just 28.7g, and for comparison, the 45mm Apple Watch 8 weighs 51.5g with GPS and cellular support.It can track your activity, heartbeat, ECG, and temperature, and analyze your body composition and sleep habits, although good luck wearing such an obtrusive watch in your sleep.Now our knurled, rotatable friend is back, and it has control of the watch features.By the third night, I had everything in place, it got my light, deep, and REM sleep, my blood oxygen levels which vary widely through the night, and even my temperature range.You can turn it counterclockwise to see notifications or the right to access key watch features like exercise modes.The 47mm size costs \u00a3399 for Bluetooth-only and \u00a3459 for the LTE-capable watch.Australian Samsung users can expect to pay AU$699 for the 43mm Bluetooth-only watch, AU$799 for a 43mm LTE-capable model, AU$749 for 47mm Bluetooth-only option, and AU $849 for a 47mm LTE-capable watch.I found the button a bit confusing because there's no physical indication that you can freely remove the band, you just have to press and pull.It's full of useful fitness and health features and did a nice job of managing my notifications.Then there's the bezel.Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic: ScorecardSwipe to scroll horizontallySamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic: ScorecardCategoryCommentScoreValueA good price for all you get4/5DesignAttractive but big

with a very big screen.Don't buy it if...You have small or sensitive wrists\nThis is a big, fat, heavy smartwatch.You're on a budget\nYou can get all the same features (even the same battery life) with a smaller, cheaper Galaxy Watch 6.Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic: Also considerGarmin Fenix 7 Pro\nThe same great watch but slightly cheaper, without the improved AMOLED screen.Subtlety is discarded for a readable-at-a-distance watch face and an aggressive design.Separating the watch's two main, customizable buttons, for example, is an island of metal that serves no functional purpose but is clearly a callback to watch designs of old.The second time, it effectively tracked all my sleeping patterns (I have so little deep sleep) but I forgot my phone, so it missed my snoring.Battery life improved over a series of days to the point where I could finally wear it, sleep with it, and then keep wearing it the next day without having to charge it until midday.(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)There's also passive activity tracking that looks at steps, time spent, and calories burned.Instead of closing rings as you do on an Apple Watch, you're closing colorful heart-shaped bands.The touch screen lets you swipe through modes, apps, and notifications.The round screen is beautiful to look at and quite sharp thanks to a 480x480 resolution, which, in one way, beats our Apple Watch 8's 396 by 484 pixels.As a touch screen, it's fast and responsive.I had no trouble navigating to find my information, track my activities, or read and react to notifications.Even though a lot of smartwatch designs started as variations of traditional watch themes including crowns and complications, they have over time moved away from that.This is about a love of big watches and the enjoyment of other people noticing the big, bright smartwatch on your wrist.Samsung has packed the 59g (the 43mm Classic weighs just 33.3g) with features and sensors.Remember, all the prices above are for the Watch 6 Classic: for the standard Watch 6 prices, you'll need to check out our Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 review.I wore both the Apple Watch 8 and Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 classic whenever I went for a walk.(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)Improved Sleep featuresCustom WorkoutsComprehensive heart health informationWhile email, meeting, weather, and other app notifications are table stakes for most smartwatches, companies like Samsung are still innovating on wearable health, wellness, and fitness features.Sometimes, it didn't work, and the watch recommended I moisturize my fingers.Image 1

thing.You don't buy the large Samsung Galaxy 6 Classic for extra features or even more battery life.I can also use Samsung's rich Wear app to manage all my watch's settings and features, including choosing from among an extensive collection of watch faces that include graphical and animated treatments, faces devoted to health and information, your photos, and classic watch style faces.I'm not a great sleeper and the watch knows it.Value score: 4/5Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic: Design(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)Larger 47mm sizesRotating bezel looks greatStylish and boldI have drawers full of classic analog, windup watches, and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic would look at home next to any of them.I have not done the sleep tracking often enough to acquire a sleep animal designation from Samsung.The latter, though, requires you to keep your phone nearby as it uses those mics to pick up the snoring sounds.To be clear, I hate wearing watches to track my sleep habits, None of them are comfortable but the 47mm Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is a true edge case.Early Samsung smartwatches had it but it was gone in Galaxy Watch 5.I didn't go climbing but did dunk the smartwatch in some water, after which it was no worse for the wear.Design-wise, this is a watch to get you noticed.My wife often complains about my snoring, so I find this surprising.This is a big watch, measuring 47mm: 46.5 x 46.5 x 10.9 mm, and weighing 59g.Not sure why I would care about that anyway.I did use the watch to check my ECG, which always came up normal, and to see my heart rate hold steady in the low 60s.Overall, I really like the WearOS 4, OneUI 5 interface.The process is called bioelectric impedance analysis, and it's awkward but works.Otherwise, it's a perfect companion for your best Samsung Galaxy Phone.More importantly, the mobile CPU seems to manage the watch's processing needs while not sapping battery life.Samsung rates the watch for up to 30-hour battery life with the Always On display on.The watch guides you to stay still and extend your arms so your armpits are open.The LTE-enabled watches, which do not require a smartphone to access the internet, cost a little extra: $449.99 for the 43mm model, and $479.99 for the 47mm.In the UK, prices start at \u00a3369 for the Bluetooth-only 43mm model and \u00a3429 for the 43mm LTE option.For my free weights,

the bezel, even as I acknowledge that there is no practical reason for it to exist.It certainly makes it a good performer, as the watch is peppy and responsive.I don't love the size but that may be a personal preference.Once inside each feature, the bezel can walk you through app controls and settings.(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)Performance and battery life score: 5/5Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic: verdictIf you want everything the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 offers but in a much bigger and maybe more traditional-looking package, the 47 mm Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is for you.I know, it's all a bit weird.Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic: One minute review(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)Unveiled at Samsung Unpacked 2023, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic was overshadowed by those new foldables (the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 5) and probably didn't get all the love it deserves.I'm not a runner, so I didn't try this out.Some activity and health-tracking options.With it off, it jumps to a rated 40 hours.On the fitness front, Samsung manages to be somewhat more proactive than Apple.I loved this.Samsung has most of the fitness routines covered including running, walking, cycling, hiking, swimming (indoor and out), treadmill, exercise bike, circuit training, weight machines, and other.Like the Apple Watch, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (and its siblings) will remind you to stand up and get moving and will cheer you when you've done so.The watch can even assess your body composition, which is something I've never done before.The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is packed with features that track all manner of your physical well-being.You can check out our Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 vs Apple Watch 8 comparison piece for more info there.With IP68 and military-spec ratings for withstanding dips, shocks, drops, and wide temperature variations, the smartwatch is ready for a dive (50 meters for 10 minutes) and a climb up your nearest mountain.In my testing, early disappointment gave way to satisfaction and eventually glee.All of them share the same features and battery life, so the choice ultimately comes down to fashion and the flexibility of your pocketbook.For some, the rotating bezel is a defining and desirable feature.Read our full Garmin Fenix 7 Pro reviewApple Watch Ultra\nApple's offering to the outdoor watch space is incredible in every way, apart from that lower battery life.Even Samsung's baseline Galaxy Watch 6 has shed many of the analog watch accouterments in favor of sleek clean lines and a perfectly flat watch face.The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, though, goes in a different direction, adopting the retro look of a beefy analog windup.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Speculation that it could bring on a perfect power grid or easily make trains levitate sparked a frenzy to test whether LK-99 really was as game-changing as portrayed by the original team.That saves a lot of energy from being lost and also makes for powerful electromagnets.But there are already well over a dozen papers on ArXiv casting doubt on LK-99.There are other superconductors used today in quantum computers and MRI machines.That happens with superconductors because they expel a magnetic field through a phenomenon called the Meissner effect.What made LK-99 so exciting initially was the prospect of having a new superconductor that could work at room temperature and under ambient pressure.But they only work in extremely cold temperatures (hundreds of degrees below zero Fahrenheit) or under very high pressures.LK-99 hasn\u2019t turned out to be the miraculous superconductor some people initially claimed it was.Proving whether LK-99 was the real deal depended on whether other researchers could replicate the Korean researchers\u2019 results.It is a very highly resistive poor quality material.No point in fighting with the truth,\u201d the University of Maryland\u2019s Condensed Matter Theory Center (CMTC) posted on August 7th.Prestigious research labs across the globe took on the task, as did enthusiastic amateurs caught up in a wave of viral social media posts about LK-99.Some people livestreamed their efforts on Twitch.\u201cWith a great deal of sadness, we now believe that the game is over.There were inconsistencies in data they published, and many outside experts had their doubts from the start.\u201cThere is no sign of superconductivity in LK-99 at room temperature,\u201d says one preprint from the CSIR-National Physical Laboratory in India.Having a superconductor that can be used in more normal conditions would open up all kinds of possibilities, ranging from improving existing technologies, like more powerful medical imaging machines, to potentially bringing moonshot technologies like nuclear fusion reactors within reach.Period.A slew of research groups have released studies that counter claims originally made about LK-99.Another popular\u00a0video\u00a0on social media showed another shard of LK-99, made by a research team from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, appearing to levitate.That means it can be magnetized and then attracted or repelled by other magnetic materials (iron, for example, is ferromagnetic).The researchers who discovered it shared a video of a fragment of the material appearing to partially levitate over a magnet.\u201cNo point in fighting with the truth.\u201d\n\nA superconductor is any material that can conduct electricity with zero resistance (The Verge has a more in-depth explainer here).The newly discovered material made headlines after a research team claimed it was the first room-temperature superconductor, which could revolutionize our energy system.The Quantum Energy Research Centre in South Korea, which published the paper, did not respond to requests for comment.That keeps them from being deployed more widely in ways that could potentially change daily life.But hopes that levitation meant that LK-99 is a superconductor were dashed this week after another preprint posed another explanation for why the material might float.(That was one of the papers cited by the University of Maryland\u2019s Condensed Matter Theory Center this week when it posted that \u201cthe game is over.\u201d)\n\nAnother crucial test for LK-99 was over its ability to levitate.LK99 is NOT a superconductor, not even at room temperatures (or at very low temperatures).RelatedThe LK-99 \u2018superconductor\u2019 went viral \u2014 here\u2019s what the experts think\n\nNow, a body of evidence has piled up that disproves claims about LK-99.\u201cThere may be room temperature superconductors to find, but this does not seem to be one,\u201d Chris Grovenor, professor of materials at the University of Oxford and director of the Centre for Applied Superconductivity, tells The Verge in an email.The International Center for Quantum Materials in China found evidence that the material is ferromagnetic.Some big-name labs, like the US Department of Energy\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory, have yet to share their findings.\u201cWe believe that our new development will be a brand-new historical event that opens a new era for humankind,\u201d researchers who discovered the LK-99 wrote in a now controversial paper they published in late July without peer review.They set out to make samples of the material and test it themselves.Labs hurriedly published their own results on ArXiv, the same server for preprints (papers that haven\u2019t undergone peer review) where the original papers on LK-99 first appeared.But the results so far indicate that LK-99 is not a superconductor, at room temperature or otherwise.",

            "paraphrased_content": "As for the truck driver, authorities issued a summons for reckless driving.Regulators with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are opening a probe involving a fatal crash involving a Tesla Model Y.Tesla says the system isn\u2019t truly automated and requires active human supervision.All told, the agency suspects the system has been involved in 23 deaths since 2016.The Fauquier County Sheriff's Office provided more details on the accident, saying that the tractor trailer attempted to turn onto a highway from a truck stop when the Tesla struck the side and slid underneath the trailer.These regulators believe that the 57-year-old Tesla driver was relying on the company\u2019s advanced driver assistance programs at the time of the accident, according to a report by Reuters.The summons indicates that authorities blame the truck\u2019s driver for the incident, but Tesla\u2019s assistance program is supposed to account for mistakes stemming from other people on the road, thus the NHTSA investigation.In 2021, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) urged the NHTSA to issue stricter regulations for autonomous driving, stating in its letter that \u201cTesla is testing on public roads a highly automated AV technology but with limited oversight or reporting requirements.\u201d\nTesla\u2019s proprietary Autopilot technology is intended to steer, accelerate and brake within the vehicle\u2019s lane, while an enhanced system assists with changing lanes on highways.The Tesla driver was pronounced dead at the scene.The company hasn\u2019t responded to a request for comment by Reuters regarding this latest accident and the newly-opened probe.To that end, the safety regulator has opened more than three dozen investigations into crashes involving Tesla vehicles and their advanced assistance algorithms.The accident, occurring on July 19, found a Tesla striking a tractor-trailer truck in Virginia, fatally wounding the driver of the automobile.",

            "paraphrased_content": "But even with that low bar, Push seemingly hasn\u2019t really succeeded in the court of player opinion.We\u2019ve heard L\u00facio and Reinhardt share tons of cute moments talking to each other in spawn rooms, but because they haven\u2019t officially met in the game\u2019s canon, when they do in the Rio mission, they don\u2019t know each other at all, and it feels jarring.That\u2019s not wholly bad, as it means that we finally have the chance to see things we\u2019ve only heard referenced in voice lines \u2014 like the contentious relationship between Zenyatta and Ramattra\u00a0\u2014 directly addressed and enshrined in canon.Her presence in a match is much more pronounced than other healers because she\u2019s so offensively stacked in addition to her healing.Since I\u2019m a support main, I chose Brigitte, and I hated her.I\u2019ve long been the kind of player who values story over all other elements in a game.To be clear, the story missions aren\u2019t bad!Firstly, my experience in early access was just custom games filled with bots and is, therefore, not really representative of what live matches will feel like.I have a unique and complicated relationship with Overwatch.But I held out, believing that losing whatever PvE was going to be would be okay because I was still getting story missions.Not so much anymore.She\u2019s a powerful, offensive healer who didn\u2019t feel intimidating to learn like Lifeweaver was.She\u2019s got lil\u2019 cucumbers under her eyes!I love the idea of Overwatch, but the game itself?Image: Blizzard\n\nIllari feels similar to but much more powerful than Moira offensively and with respect to her healing output.Because of seven years of essentially no story that wasn\u2019t just flashbacks, the game has to officially and explicitly state information that we, as players, have already come to understand.As a support main, I\u2019m generally good at keeping other people healed, but I tend to neglect my own health bar.I want to see their relationships develop.Now, is that because using it netted me a triple kill, winning me play of the game, which is exceedingly rare but very prestigious for a support player?So while my role is vital, it typically goes uncelebrated in a match in favor of the big team wipes tanks and damage heroes do.If one team gets an early lead, it\u2019s really difficult for the opposing team to make a comeback, leading to demoralizing blowouts.The event, which coincides with season 6 of the battle pass, offers a new hero, a new game mode, and, perhaps most importantly, new story missions that, for the first time, advance Overwatch\u2019s story.Also, Illari\u2019s llama pajama skin is so stinkin\u2019 cute, giving me yet another reason to love her.I really enjoyed how, in the Rio mission, you had to fight against a huge boss robot that required a bit of actual strategy to defeat beyond just shooting it in the face.But because those conversations happened in the primordial vacuum of the spawn room, they aren\u2019t canon.So while Flashpoint\u2019s been in development for a while, its addition to the game comes at a time when it feels like it\u2019s meant to respond to the disappointment surrounding Push.To reiterate, I don\u2019t think any of Invasion\u2019s many new offerings are bad or of poor quality.Flashpoint\u2019s high\u2026er point, though, was playing as the new support hero, Illari.Winston, in the face of the danger posed by the evil shadow organization Talon and a brewing robot uprising, sends up a beacon to rally former Overwatch operatives to combat these looming threats.Remixing is actually a big theme for the story missions, as each is essentially a remixed version of a typical Overwatch game type with some extra bells and whistles.We\u2019ve already seen how these characters interact with each other from the voice lines we hear at the start of each match.In addition to her secondary fire being a direct healing beam, Illari can also place a powerful healing turret anywhere on the battlefield.The first team to three points wins.If you enjoy Overwatch and don\u2019t have the kind of emotional investment I have in the game, then this will be a great addition \u2014 if you can stomach the price tag.Now, with the Invasion event and its three story missions, we get to see the events that happen immediately after Winston gets the gang back together.The missions\u2019 story elements, however, are just okay.And, of course, it\u2019s always gonna feel good to transform into his turret mode to mow down enemies as a sentient minigun.From cinematics, we already know Reinhardt hates omnics.But with Flashpoint\u2019s simplicity and its similarity to an existing game type, it doesn\u2019t work for me.Deploying her shield and swinging her flail around just didn\u2019t jive with my style of play, and I was having a crappy time playing the mission.In Overwatch 2, Bastion\u2019s old self-healing ability has changed to a sticky grenade launcher that I had no problem managing.Not so with Illari.Teams fight to control one of five points spread out equally on maps that are the largest in the game.But before we get there, we have to wait for the game to catch up with all the world-building.There are other elements to the missions that introduce variety and prevent them from being straight-up story-driven reskins of Overwatch matches.Image: Blizzard\n\nThe missions\u2019 story elements, however, are just okay.That\u2019s\u2026 all I can really say about it, as it doesn\u2019t feel productive describing what it feels like to play.That\u2019s unfortunate because I return to this game over and over, specifically because of the characters.It is so special to me as a person and a journalist that I hoped adding the one thing I care about the most would be enough to win me back.From his older voice lines, we also already know that he\u2019s working on that prejudice.On a whim, I changed to Bastion, and my entire outlook transformed.But the game has to explicitly spell all that out because it hasn\u2019t officially been able to until this point.The story missions take place either in totally new locations like Gothenburg or in places familiar to players but have been remixed into an entirely new map like Toronto and Rio de Janeiro.With precise placement, Illari can keep her team healthy in the middle of an intense fight while also putting out enough damage to turn the tide of battle.I had hoped the missions would offer me some new nugget to latch onto, and it didn\u2019t.That feels bad to say that because I don\u2019t know what more is, and it seems unfair to ask for more from a development team that\u2019s been through and done so much already.I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like that aspect because I have my roster of comfort heroes, and I stick with them.They need something more.But for Gothenburg, I was forced to pick from a slate of characters I never use.In Toronto, your team has to defend locations and prevent them from being overrun by hostiles, kind of like playing a Control match.Overwatch 2\u2019s Invasion event, which goes live today, is the game\u2019s biggest update since penciling in the \u201c2\u201d in October of last year.Though these missions are brand new and put characters in new situations with new people they are meeting for the first time, I didn\u2019t really feel like the story itself was doing anything new, especially with respect to the characters.But let\u2019s not split hairs here.The Gothenburg mission also has a fun, if frustrating at higher difficulties, tower defense moment in which you deploy and repair turrets to assist in protecting a giant cannon.Secondly, it\u2019s just the control game type on a much larger map.After all these years and being set in my ways, I appreciated that Overwatch still had some surprises for me in unlikely hero choices.I love the idea of Overwatch, but the game itself?And while I appreciate and enjoy all the new coming to Overwatch 2, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that this all feels too little and too late.But when it\u2019s time to actually play the game, I balk and look elsewhere for entertainment.The characters have been Overwatch\u2019s one shining highlight in the midst of its sad-to-watch decline.But as we know, PvE isn\u2019t happening anymore.Seven years later, the \u201cZero Hour\u201d animated short that arrived with Overwatch 2 shows some of those heroes finally answering that call.Image: Blizzard\n\nFlashpoint is Overwatch 2\u2019s newest game type after Push was introduced at the game\u2019s launch as a replacement for the Assault game type.Flashpoint is Overwatch 2\u2019s newest game mode.In the story missions, you don\u2019t have access to Overwatch 2\u2019s full roster; you\u2019re instead made to choose between a handful of characters that are present for that particular part of the story.So when PvE was announced, I was jazzed because I love this game so much.Her ultimate, Captive Sun, which lets me fire these big concussive shots that not only slowed my enemies but also made them explode, is my favorite ultimate in the game.A lot of lapsed players like myself pinned their hopes on PvE, and when that went away, their hope for the game died with it.I love what the developers have done with the game\u2019s characters, story, and its overall aesthetic.Instead of fighting for control of one point, resetting, and fighting again, you do all that on the same map \u2014 no resets.Sure.Not so much anymore.Image: Blizzard\n\nThe Invasion event also has three story missions, which are meant to essentially restart Overwatch\u2019s story that began with the \u201cRecall\u201d animated short released in 2016.But now that they\u2019re here, I\u2019ve come too late to the realization that story missions just aren\u2019t enough.But three 20\u201330 minute missions that essentially repackage the typical Overwatch quick play experience in admittedly gorgeous, new locations is a tough buy for someone looking to fall in love with the game again, especially since you have to pay an extra $15 for it.These missions are square one for Overwatch\u2019s story, so they\u2019ve become square one for the characters, too.The Rio de Janeiro mission reminds me of Deathmatch, requiring players to simply kill everything that moves, and in Gothenburg, you escort a payload.His kit has changed significantly between original Overwatch and now for the better.I\u2019m a support main \u2014 my job is making sure my teammates don\u2019t die.Because Assault was unfairly reviled, Push didn\u2019t have to be much to make players happy again.In Gothenburg, your job is payload.They\u2019re actually a pleasant, if ho-hum, experience, exacerbated by the fact I was playing with bots.I played L\u00facio in the Rio mission and Baptiste in Toronto.I want those interactions.Each point unlocks sequentially, and once a team reaches 100 percent control, the next point unlocks.New Junk City is one of the two Flashpoint maps coming with season 6.",

            "paraphrased_content": "\u201cThe FEC has unanimously asked it to revisit that choice and to grant us broader authority to punish fraud by campaigns, but as is Congress\u2019 right, it has chosen to ignore that request.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s vote comes after a flurry of action from both Congress and the White House to regulate AI.\u201cIt would be news to many, I suspect, to learn that the FEC may police candidates telling lies about their opponents.In April, the RNC released an AI-generated ad in response to President Joe Biden\u2019s election announcement, painting a dystopian version of the future if he won reelection.The petition, filed by the advocacy group Public Citizen, calls on the commission to leverage its authority to punish fraud by creating rules banning candidates and political parties from using AI to misrepresent their opponents.The White House also secured a handful of voluntary commitments from some of the top AI companies, like Altman\u2019s company, to develop the technology responsibly.After weeks of back and forth, the Federal Election Commission decided that it will, maybe, make rules regulating the use of AI-generated content in political ads.But Congress has dragged its feet on approving any rules regulating tech despite the wave of hearings, legislation, and heated statements they\u2019ve released in recent years.\u201cThe FEC\u2019s decision to proceed with a public comment period is an encouraging sign that the threat AI poses to our democracy may finally be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nRepublican Commissioner Allen Dickerson opposed the petition when it was first filed earlier this summer but voted to start the commenting period on Thursday.\u201cAI is increasingly being used to generate misleading content that can be used against candidates regardless of party,\u201d Klobuchar said in a statement to The Verge.The Democratic National Committee and the RNC have declined to comment on whether they\u2019d issue internal rules around AI\u2019s use in the past.Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-NY) was the first to put out a bill requiring campaigns and political groups to disclose when they include AI-generated content in ads.In May, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying that lawmakers should quickly pass new rules regulating the industry and specifically asking for a government licensing program.Never Back Down used AI to mimic former President Donald Trump\u2019s voice in an ad last month.These attack videos have migrated to social platforms that have similarly loose rules.At an open meeting Thursday, the FEC voted to open up the petition for public comment, kicking off a process that could result in new rules governing how campaigns use AI going into effect before the end of the year.That was Congress\u2019 choice,\u201d Dickerson said during Thursday\u2019s meeting.I plan to introduce bipartisan legislation to make the FEC\u2019s authority to deal with this clear, whether they already have the authority or not.\u201d\n\nOnce the petition hits the federal register, the public will have 60 days to comment.Still, Dickerson questioned whether the FEC has the necessary authority to implement the requested rules, suggesting that Public Citizen and others should be demanding federal lawmakers take action first.The plan asks lawmakers to address a variety of risks associated with AI, from national security and job loss to copyright and misinformation.Meanwhile, political groups like the Republican National Committee and Never Back Down, a Ron DeSantis super PAC, have already started using the tech.\u201cWill will also need Congress to act on banning across the board or requiring disclosure across the board in other spaces that campaign ads are being generated.\u201d\n\nAfter Thursday\u2019s vote, Klobuchar said that she would be introducing a new bill to increase the FEC\u2019s authority over AI.While Congress has made clear its intent to put up rules around the technology, few actual bills have been introduced.In June, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) put out a plan for how Congress should approach regulating the industry called the SAFE Innovation Framework.With the 2024 elections approaching, Gilbert and Public Citizen issued their petition as a means of getting some rules on the books before campaign season takes off in full force.In June, the DeSantis campaign shared a video containing fake images of Trump kissing Anthony Fauci, a former White House chief medical advisor who led the US\u2019s response to covid-19.Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) has introduced a companion to Clark\u2019s measure in the Senate.\u201cThis is one piece of the solution,\u201d Gilbert said in an interview with The Verge on Wednesday.\u201cWhile today\u2019s decision is a step forward, we need the FEC to act now.\u201cThe need to regulate deepfakes and other deceptive uses of AI in election ads becomes more urgent with each passing day\u201d\n\n\u201cThe need to regulate deepfakes and other deceptive uses of AI in election ads becomes more urgent with each passing day,\u201d Lisa Gilbert, Public Citizen executive vice president, said in a statement Thursday.",

            "content": "The Last Voyage of the Demeter turns one of the most riveting chapters from Bram Stokers Dracula into a soggy feature-length horror that never finds its sea legs.\r\nByCharles Pulliam-Moore, a reporter\u2026 [+5736 chars]",
            "paraphrased_content": "That sort of willful ignorance can work in horror films, especially when the story\u2019s done a solid job of establishing how and why people might be able to delude themselves into ignoring the obvious.It\u2019s just a shame that energy isn\u2019t more evenly distributed because, when it\u2019s present, you can see a glimpse of the truly great Dracula movie this could have been.Being a seasoned sailor who\u2019s spent years ferrying valuable goods on the Demeter, there\u2019s very little about the world that still truly shocks Captain Eliot (Liam Cunningham) by the time we first meet him in the movie\u2019s opening act as he and his crew are preparing to set sail once again.But rather than immediately getting to the important work of creating the kind of unsettling atmosphere you\u2019d expect from a movie about Dracula on a 20th-century boat, The Last Voyage of the Demeter gets entirely too caught up trying to positively and negatively humanize its heroes with extraneous details that don\u2019t add much to the story.Set in the same year that Dracula was actually published, The Last Voyage of the Demeter draws much of its inspiration from the seventh chapter of Stoker\u2019s novel \u2014 a short collection of newspaper clippings and a captain\u2019s log detailing how a small ship full of sailors was besieged and ultimately wrecked by a monstrous presence while traveling from Romania to England.Thankfully, the film does pick up some much-needed momentum in its final third, which is marked by a wonderful sense of desperation and hopelessness that\u2019s exactly what the rest of The Last Voyage of the Demeter needs.But for all of The Last Voyage of the Demeter\u2019s promise and its obvious desire to bring something new and inspired to the larger Dracula canon, the film never quite lives up to its full potential due to a curious lack of outright scares or a properly terrifying atmosphere.Here, though, it makes the Demeter\u2019s crew seem almost comedically hapless and leaves the film feeling like it doesn\u2019t know how else to scare viewers aside from occasionally pointing the camera at a monster dripping in VFX before it tears into someone\u2019s throat.With Eliot having recently taken in his grandson Toby (Woody Norman) following the death of his daughter, first mate Wojchek (David Dastmalchian), the Demeter\u2019s religious cook Joseph (Jon Jon Briones), and other members of the crew like Olgaren (Stefan Kapicic) all know that they\u2019re more than just colleagues to their captain.With a premise as straightforward as this\u00a0\u2014 \u201cwhat happens when a vampire sneaks its way onto a doomed boat and starts picking sailors off?\u201d \u2014 the challenge the movie\u2019s up against is one of finding a novel way of presenting a classic tale rather than full-on reworking the source material for modern sensibilities.It isn\u2019t until well into the film that everyone on the Demeter starts to become concerned with the fact that people are just straight-up disappearing from the ship while they\u2019re in the middle of the ocean.Eliot\u2019s crew is his family, and he\u2019s the key to them all making some real money transporting valuable cargo for whoever can afford their services.In the same way that you probably know what\u2019s in the massive crate the Demeter takes on, none of the villagers responsible for bringing it to the ship want anything to do with it, and they\u2019re all keen on getting back to their homes before the sun sets.Eliot, Clemens, and the rest of the Demeter\u2019s crew set sail for England despite all of the obvious red flags that something\u2019s wrong because the narrative needs them to, and there wouldn\u2019t be much of a film if they all acted with common sense.Whereas Stoker\u2019s novel was able to give you a sense of the confusion, fear, and madness that gradually overtook the Demeter\u2019s crew as their journey progressed, \u00d8vredal\u2019s film simply lays its events out without fully capitalizing on all the interesting ways it could have framed itself as a more cerebral and claustrophobic thriller.The film hits theaters on August 11th.While the film spends quite a bit of time impressing upon you how Clemens\u2019 \u2014 who Hawkins inhabits with a steely reservedness that only eases up when he\u2019s around Toby \u2014 Blackness makes people like Wojchek see him as less than, it does little to make Dracula\u2019s (Javier Botet) first proper on-screen appearance really pop the way it should.The Last Voyage of the Demeter also stars Nikolai Nikolaeff, Chris Walley, Nicolo Pasetti, and Sally Reeve.Being based on an interesting yet very sparse chapter from a novel the way The Last Voyage of the Demeter is, you can see why screenwriters Bragi Schut Jr. and Zak Olkewicz felt the need to pad this story with even more salty sailors and a brief but important exchange between Eliot and the unnamed group of fearful Romani villagers who drop off the precious, mysterious cargo he\u2019s meant to carry over the ocean.There have been so many cinematic adaptations of Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula and movies inspired by the 1897 novel over the years that it\u2019s actually quite easy to understand some of the logic behind Universal\u2019s The Last Voyage of the Demeter from director Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal.With the Demeter short-staffed ahead of its latest voyage from Romania to England, though, the sailors also know that they need some new blood on board, which is part of why doctor / philosopher / Cambridge graduate Clemens (Corey Hawkins) ends up being hired to join their ranks.There\u2019s an undeniable brilliance behind the idea of building a feature-length story around one of the most haunting and cryptic chapters from a book that\u2019s terrified multiple generations of horror lovers.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Dubbed N3, this family of chips is marketed as featuring some circuits that measure 3 nanometers, and as is the case with nearly every high-end chip technology from TSMC, the first batch of products typically go to Apple.TSMC is the world's leading contract chip manufacturer - a role that places it right at the heart of any new or existing AI products that might make their way into the market.Compare this with TSMC's revenue performance during July 2022, July 2021 and July 2020 to understand how recent trends might affect the firm's performance.The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reported its July revenue figures, which mark a monthly growth but fall annually.This had marked an 11% annual and sequential drop and given way to hope that perhaps June was the last month for poor revenue performance.Manufacturing chip products with new technology requires capitalizing high initial expenditures, which affects TSMC's gross margin for the initial phases of mass production.While it marked a 4.8% annual drop, the quarterly or sequential growth was much better as the revenue grew by 11%.In its rationale for the decision, the bank cited expectations of higher profits over the next couple of years and a larger capital expenditure as demand restorers after market recovery.A slowing market hampers TSMC's revenue growth, and this year, the drop in sales comes just as the Taiwanese fab is ramping up its latest chip manufacturing technology.This time, the trend seems different, as TSMC's revenue grew by 14% in July over June.Annually, all these were in positive growth territory, with the growth rates being 25%, 18% and 50% each.Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.For its July revenue in 2020, 2021and 2022, TSMC had reported NT$105 billion, NT$124 billion and NT$186 billion in net sales, respectively.However, this year, the firm is also facing a slowing market that might take longer than expected to resolve, according to statements made by its executives during TSMC's latest earnings call.TSMC reported NT$156 billion in revenue during June.The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.Except for the bumper year for the chip segment, which was 2022, TSMC's revenue has typically fallen between June and July, indicating that this time around, some additional factors at play have contributed to revenue growth even as the semiconductor industry waits for inventory digestion before ramping up product manufacturing and shipments.TSMC's American Depository Receipts (ADRs) are slightly higher during trading today.TSMC's latest revenue data shows that the firm raked in NT$177 billion in revenue during August.However, right around the time the Taiwanese fab released its revenue figures for June, investment bank Goldman Sachs came out with a fresh analyst note that raised TSMC's share price target by 14% to NT$700.TSMC's July Revenue Shows That Artificial Intelligence and 3nm Product Demand Might Be Lifting Company's Top Line\n2023 is an expensive year for TSMC since it will be the first full year when the company mass produces its latest chipmaking technology.There is some speculation behind this historical divergence, with the leading candidates being a growth in orders for artificial intelligence products and fresh shipments of 3-nanometer chips.However, sequentially, the revenue had dropped over the previous month in July 2020 and 2021, with the negative growth being the highest in the latter when it had stood at -16%.The biggest beneficiary of the AI boom is NVIDIA Corporation, whose management should share updates, particularly for AI, in its upcoming quarterly earnings call later this month.This is not investment advice.However, the firm has refrained from commenting on whether AI will provide a long-term growth trend, as it prefers to wait and watch before making any strong pronouncements.TSMC reported NT$177 billion in revenue for July, a roughly NT$9 billion drop over the year-ago figures but a sizeable NT$21 billion growth over the June figures.Share this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n Twitter",

to document war crimes in Ukraine.The only consumer drone it\u2019s released since was a minor hardware update to the Skydio 2 that addressed some big shortcomings.Skydio is done making drones for consumers.As part of the consumer shutdown, Skydio will no longer sell its Skydio 2 Plus Starter, Sports, Cinema, or Pro kids.Skydio began shifting its focus toward government and military use in 2020 with the launch of its self-flying X2 model.Last December, Skydio revealed its 72-pound motorized dock to let companies and agencies remotely control, charge, and protect their drones without a nearby human, too:\n\n\n\nYou can actually see on the web where the Chula Vista, California, police department autonomously flies its Skydio drones.It says it will still provide customer support for people who currently own Skydio drones while also honoring any warranties.Drones are getting boring, as my colleague Vjeran recently pointed out, and Skydio had the power to change that.\u201cThe impact we\u2019re having with our enterprise and public sector customers has become so compelling that it demands nothing less than our full focus and attention.\u201d\n\nRelatedSkydio 2 review: a drone that flies itselfSkydio R1 autonomous drone review: cruise controlSkydio announces $1,099 Skydio 2 Plus\n\nWe\u2019ve followed Skydio practically since the beginning, when it was a tiny startup led by three friends who met at MIT, which raised $3 million to produce the first drones that could truly fly themselves while dodging obstacles on the way.The company says it will also maintain an inventory of accessories, such as replacement batteries, propellers, and charging cables \u201cfor as long as we can.\u201d\n\nIn a FAQ page posted to its website, Skydio responds to a question asking whether it will make another drone for consumers, stating that \u201cwe are not able to share any updates about our future product roadmap.\u201d For now, Skydio will only sell the Skydio 2 Plus Enterprise kit.RelatedSkydio drones reportedly owned by more than 20 US police agenciesA video tour of the Skydio 2 production lineThis is the dock that lets Skydio drones truly fly themselves\n\nSkydio\u2019s been at the forefront of an explosion in industry and law enforcement use of drones not just because it\u2019s one of the few systems that can reliably fly itself but because it\u2019s US-made and because Skydio\u2019s worked to help its customers secure Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) waivers so they can actually fly those drones without a physical person watching them every step of the way.I\u2019ve always wanted a tiny folding drone that can follow me around \u2014 I\u2019ve asked CEO Adam Bry in every interview, but I guess it\u2019s not happening.If you did purchase a consumer Skydio 2 drone years ago, it\u2019s not like it was just abandoned after the company shipped it.Personally \u2014 this is Sean talking \u2014 I\u2019m sad that we\u2019ll never get a Skydio Mini that I can fold down into a bag the way I do with my DJI.And the blacklist on Chinese companies like DJI was a bit overblown \u2014 it wasn\u2019t anywhere near a complete ban, and many agencies still use DJI last I checked.Skydio did release some pretty cool new features, including a way to 3D scan your surroundings (companies are using it for inspections), program a robotic cameraman, perform sweeping gimbal rolls and generate panoramas.In an interview with The Verge at the time, Skydio CEO Adam Bry said that the company had more consumer-facing drones on the way.Though the self-flying drone startup has been denying for years it would pivot to enterprise, it confirmed on Thursday that it\u2019s sunsetting its consumer business in favor of creating drones for use by commercial businesses and the public sector.The initial $2,500 Skydio R1 fulfilled the previously broken promises of follow-me drones like Lily by legitimately being able to dodge trees while filming you around a park \u2014 as long as their branches weren\u2019t too small.\u201cOur drones are making the core industries that our civilization runs on \u2014 public safety, transportation, energy, construction, and defense \u2014 safer and more efficient,\u201d Skydio CEO Adam Bry writes.These days, the company shares a parking lot with GoPro.It was the US government\u2019s decision to blacklist Chinese drones amidst increasing demand from enterprise and military customers, which first shot Skydio to a $1 billion valuation in 2021 and over $2.2 billion as of this year.The company also announced that it received a nationwide BVLOS authorization in Japan, though it wasn\u2019t quite as impressive as Skydio hinted.(A visual observer is required by law in some countries, including the United States, the UK, and across the European Union.)Skydio\u2019s not the only drone-in-a-box company that\u2019s gotten drones approved for BVLOS flight, nor the only one to get the US government\u2019s nod, mind you.And while the $999 Skydio 2 arguably wasn\u2019t competitive with DJI as a photographer or cinematographer\u2019s drone, a three-year-old can fly it around:\n\n\n\nBut what grew the company wasn\u2019t its consumer drones, which were (at least initially) hand-assembled in pricey Redwood City, California.Japanese companies and agencies can\u2019t just buy Skydio drones and fly them unseen; the company confirmed to The Verge that each needs to get approval from Japan\u2019s regulator using a template Skydio can provide.",

            "paraphrased_content": "More vulnerabilities discovered, and then exploited by threat actors, comes with the territory of being a significant player in the operating system landscape, and Apple\u2019s had to act on numerous occasions lately to keep its customers safe.Recently, Apple changed the way it pushes security updates, in order to be faster and more agile.As a result, spotting malicious programs for Mac users could be a significantly harder undertaking.What have others said about Apple\u2019s security posture?In its writeup, Australian outlet TechGuide says many Mac users have a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d, allowing hackers to move in in greater numbers.\u201cApple has a narrower threat level than Microsoft or Google and for this reason many users think they don\u2019t need security software,\u201d the publication states.It allowed threat actors to run arbitrary code on target endpoints, by tricking victims into opening malicious websites.\u201cStatistics show that the vast majority of Mac owners use older generations of macOS,\u201d the researchers concluded.Roughly a month ago, it released an RSR update to address a zero-day vulnerability that was allegedly affecting fully-patched Apple devices, Macs included.We all know we don\u2019t need stuff like that on iPhones, iPads, MacBooks,\u2026!You should also check out our list of the best malware removal tools, as well as best firewalls.And given that the two share many components between one another (like the web rendering engine WebKit), attacks against Macs are becoming more efficient.Apple finds itself consistently having to patch actively exploited vulnerabilities as threat actors employ social engineering vectors and spray-and-pray techniques.\u201dFurthermore, while macOS might not be that interesting, iOS most certainly is.:)\u201d Another user, who claimed to have been robbed of roughly $10,000 worth of cryptocurrency in an elaborate scam, asked \u201cBut how can a Trojan bypass the Apple security\u2026?\u201dNot everyone is that comfortable not running any antivirus programs on their Macs, though.As things start to shift in the computing industry, we\u2019ll be seeing more and more cyberattacks targeting Apple devices.This is the general conclusion of a new report by cybersecurity researchers Bitdefender.While that might sound as a good thing at first, it makes hackers put extra effort into making the malware look and feel legitimate.Apple\u2019s Macbook Pro or iPhone devices are often perceived as safer, from a cybersecurity standpoint, compared to those from Microsoft or Google, mostly because of its \u201cwalled garden\u201d approach.Analysis: Why does it matter?According to Bitdefender, the analysis matters because it might shatter Apple\u2019s perceived image of being the \u201csuperior\u201d ecosystem in terms of cybersecurity.However, another key reason why hackers aren\u2019t as interested in Macs as they are in Windows or Linux devices is the smaller market share Apple holds.It\u2019s an important step in the right direction because, as Bitdefender says, many (if not most) users procrastinate updating software and deploying security fixes.The flaw being addressed was tracked as CVE-2023-37450, and was described as an arbitrary code execution bug in the WebKit browser engine.Go deeperTo learn more about, make sure to read our article on the most exploited vulnerabilities in 2022.In its \u201cmacOS threat landscape report\u201d, the firm noted that Apple\u2019s market share almost doubled in the last decade, citing figures from Statcounter that state Apple\u2019s desktop operating system held 10% of the market share in 2013, but now holds almost 18%.Bitdefender says Mac users are targeted by three key threats: Trojans, Adware, and Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA).Of all those detections, around half (52.7%) were for EvilQuest.Also, don\u2019t forget to read our in-depth guide on the best endpoint protection right now.Sometimes, these patches don\u2019t even require the device to be restarted.It introduced a new feature called Rapid Security Response (RSR), which delivers important updates outside the regular patching schedule.But while Apple users enjoy less risk due to the platform\u2019s smaller footprint, Macs aren\u2019t bulletproof.At the time, Apple said it was aware of reports that the issue may have been actively exploited.An important caveat with all of the vulnerabilities being exploited on Macs is that there must always be user interaction.One user chimed in to say \u201cI don\u2019t trust Apple security that\u2019s way I got Bitdefender Premium Security for Mac ON all the time.\u201d Others said that while they use a different antivirus solution, they\u2019d never let Apple be the sole caretaker of their endpoints.Of the three, Trojans are the biggest single threat, making up more than half of all threat detections.\u201cThreat actors are devoting time and resources to exploit the larger attack surface provided by Microsoft.\u201cMacs are far less targeted than Windows computers, as Microsoft still rules the land with 63% of the desktop market,\u201d the report reads.Discussing Bitdefender\u2019s tool, one user says: \u201cNow, I have no use of such tools - as our household only uses Apple products.\u201cThe report comes as more than 45% of Australians are now using at least one Apple operating system.\u201dOn Twitter, there\u2019s very little chatter about Bitdefender\u2019s latest report, but earlier tweets show the cybersecurity researchers hitting the nail on the head when it comes to Apple users\u2019 sentiment on cybersecurity.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Others have been suffering with them for years without a fix in sight, with a single thread on Sonos\u2019 forum full of nearly 1,000 responses from disappointed Arc owners.I\u2019m also able to make the audio pop simply by navigating around the Xbox dashboard and then moving to content that isn\u2019t Dolby Atmos and back again.I was shocked to learn that hundreds of Sonos Arc owners have experienced these extremely loud audio pops for nearly three years without a fix.Now, however, my Sonos Arc soundbar sounds like it\u2019s exploding with a startling loud bang and a series of audio pops when I try to use Dolby Atmos content.As this is an issue stemming from the way various devices are working together, there are a range of tests our team needs to conduct to understand the scope and develop a targeted solution for each setup.One detailed post in the ongoing Sonos support thread suggests that the problem could be related to how the Xbox Series X and Apple TV 4K use a Dolby MAT 2.0 encoder to output sound.Sonos says it can\u2019t reliably reproduce the issue, but that\u2019s bizarre since many customers can.The audio pop is incredibly loud and startling, and the first time I experienced it, I thought the soundbar had exploded and died since the light flashed red and it looked like it briefly turned off.I bought a Sonos Arc soundbar and an LG OLED G2 six months ago to use with my Xbox Series X thinking it would be the most convenient way to expand my existing Sonos setup to handle Dolby Atmos audio from apps like Netflix, Apple TV Plus, and Disney Plus.We are also engaging our contacts at third party manufacturers to further explore possible solutions.While it\u2019s possible to go on to watch Dolby Atmos content after the big bang, I have to do so with my miniature dachshund hiding in fear for the rest of the evening.If you\u2019re even considering a Sonos Arc soundbar to use with an Xbox Series X or Apple TV 4K, avoid this $900 soundbar until Sonos has fixed this problem or can give us a more detailed response.We\u2019ll let you know as soon as we have an update to share.The only workaround that has worked for me is disabling Dolby Atmos, and it\u2019s the same for many other owners stuck with a $900 Dolby Atmos soundbar that can\u2019t handle Atmos.Here\u2019s what Sonos product manager Scott Fink had to say in a statement to The Verge:\n\nWe are aware that a small percentage of customers have experienced an interoperability issue which is causing a popping sound on Arc.After contacting Sonos support to add my voice to the growing number of affected users, I was met with two official workarounds: disable CEC on devices or disable Dolby Atmos and use Dolby Digital 5.1 instead.The team has been and is actively working towards a solution, the biggest issue we have is reproducing the loud pop.\u201d\n\nRegardless of how complicated this issue might be, it\u2019s ridiculous that it has been ongoing for nearly three years without a fix.What we know now is that this issue occurs on some Dolby Atmos enabled audio products, including Arc, when connected to certain combinations of streaming devices and TVs while playing Dolby Atmos content.We are committed to finding the root cause and we\u2019re continuing to test for a reliable reproduction of what customers are describing online and in conversations with our support team.The \u201csolution\u201d to disable Dolby Atmos \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel good,\u201d according to KeithFromSonos, a Sonos employee who regularly posts on Reddit answering community concerns.I\u2019ve had to disable Dolby Atmos to avoid this audio pop, as it has been genuinely making my heart skip a few beats.Perhaps I\u2019ll offer to ship my 65-inch TV, Xbox Series X, and Sonos Arc to Sonos so it can reproduce the issue and figure out a fix.Not every Sonos Arc owner will experience the issue, though.I\u2019ve been experiencing these loud audio pops over the past few weeks, with no changes to my setup.Only because I don\u2019t want anyone to get tied to the idea that something is coming \u2018soon\u2019.One of these workarounds means I lose the ability for my TV to control other devices over HDMI-CEC, and the other means disabling Dolby Atmos on a soundbar that\u2019s supposed to be designed for it!But after nearly three years without a fix, Sonos doesn\u2019t seem to be any closer to resolving things as the company is struggling to reproduce the issues customers are experiencing.It\u2019s particularly prevalent with people who use an Xbox Series X or Apple TV 4K to push Dolby Atmos content to their TV, and it seems like this combination is causing issues.Sonos markets its Arc soundbar as being able to \u201cbring all your entertainment to life and experience breathtakingly realistic spatial audio powered by Dolby Atmos.\u201d The reality for many is that it\u2019s a Dolby Atmos soundbar that can\u2019t handle Atmos properly.\u201cI hesitate to say a \u2018fix\u2019 is in the works.I\u2019m not alone, either.Otherwise, you\u2019ll probably be left like hundreds or thousands of other Sonos customers with a Dolby Atmos soundbar that can\u2019t handle Dolby Atmos properly.",

            "paraphrased_content": "It was a bit of a slower weapon than many of the other starting classes and the MP couldn\u2019t keep up to hurling fireballs during every encounter.First dubbed Lords of the Fallen 2, the follow-up to 2014\u2019s masocore action RPG was supposed to be made internally at CI Games (whereas the original was developed by Deck 13) for a 2017 release.One of the developers offered a sneak peek of a scimitar and light shield selection that seemed ripe for the classic parry and riposte combo that I look forward to trying out in the full retail release out later this year.Often times when there\u2019s an impassable wall or insurmountable gap in the player\u2019s way, the Umbral realm can hold the answer on how to proceed.Both abilities require wielding the lantern on the character\u2019s offhand, so swapping from a casting conduit or shield is required.The player champion might not be able to jump freely but don\u2019t let that feel like there\u2019s a limit to the exploration that can be found in Lords of the Fallen.Few Soulslikes have had the tumultuous development cycle as Lords of the Fallen, a title that has changed hands just as often as crowned with a new title.Delving into the darkness of Umbral is marked with grotesque abominations and bones and sinew decorating where trees and rocks once were.It\u2019s also used to Flay and Siphon Souls from enemies to build up wither/stagger damage, while the latter can extract Umbral parasites from more impervious foes.Related StoryKai TatsumotoLords of the Fallen Q&A \u2013 Hexworks Talks Lore, Co-Op, PvP, Multiple Endings, NG+ and MoreWhile the first Lords of the Fallen was developed to be in line with the more tactical and deliberate Dark Souls entries, the upcoming title of the same name instead aims to achieve a faster pace more akin to Deck13\u2019s The Surge and Bloodborne.That effort failed, and CI Games passed the baton to Defiant Studios, which only lasted about a year on the project.Lords of the Fallen will be available on Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC (Steam).Another important aspect of the Axiom/Umbral dynamic is in the lantern that allows players to peer into the other realm.It\u2019s a mechanic that I didn\u2019t fully grasp during the extended preview session beyond the act of siphoning away those Umbral parasites and will need to spend more time with the final build to really dig into the mechanics for greater appreciation.What was available in the opening hours before getting to the main hub was somewhat limiting to see how the progression systems play together, but those surprises shouldn\u2019t take long for players to see for themselves at launch.Ahead of the October 13th release later this year, Wccftech was invited to an afternoon gameplay session, getting both hands-on with the opening act on PC and interviewing two key developers on the Hexworks team.Sadly, our hands-on session wasn\u2019t set up to play alongside the other folks that attended, from those at IGN and RPG Site, among other Souls content creators.Lords of the Fallen will also feature seamless online co-op where players can play through nearly the entire adventure together in co-op and as was noted in our interview with the project leads, the world state follows that of the host to prevent two players from being in different shifts of Axiom/Umbral.From character creation to the first exploration of the main hub locale, we were given the opportunity to see the dual worlds of Axiom and Umbral firsthand.Parrying enemies also has the added effect of building up a stagger gauge that knocks an enemy down for either a quick execution for lesser enemies or a brutal counterattack for more elite enemies such as named bosses.It\u2019s because of this realm transition that Lords of the Fallen adapts a two-life approach that was first seen in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.For my personal playthrough, I opted for the Inferno, a class that starts with a simple Pyromancy-adjacent fireball as well as a polearm.This also marked one of the first times that the Unreal Engine 5-developed title would be playable by a wider audience.Players will be able to get their hands on Hexworks' inaugural Soulslike when it arrives on October 13th.Gear collecting and customization wasn\u2019t yet available, namely because no weapons were discovered even when getting off the beaten path and they couldn\u2019t be upgraded due to a lack of having the blacksmith present in the hub area to do so.Eventually, the newly established Hexworks studio (with offices in Barcelona and Bucharest) is carrying the game to completion, and any numbers or subtitles have been dropped, with the reboot finally known simply as Lords of the Fallen once again (to the bane of all those involved in SEO design).Share this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n TwitterThe media representative from RPG Site that was playing next to me opted for the Archer-esque class and took out the main boss in our demo with poison arrows.Delving into the Umbral realm is a one-way trip that leaves the player locked into their decision until they reach the next checkpoint or are brought back to the last one they reached by penalty of death.Lords of the Fallen\u2019s character creation opened with nine classes to choose from, eight archetypes that neatly mirrored that of Dark Souls\u2019 opening classes and then the blank slate Condemned class that began with 9\u2019s across the board in each stat, giving them more flexibility to grow as the player sees fit for a particular character build.The core mechanic that separates Lords of the Fallen from its contemporaries is in the overlapping parallel worlds of Axiom and Umbral.However, there are times when traversing through Umbral will be necessary to proceed, whether by choice or by force.The player champion is granted a lantern that allows them to peer into the Umbral realm without making the one-way decision to transfer over.However, the times that both could be used in tandem, especially during boss fights, it was a strong build indeed.Axiom remains the main world where much of the adventure will take place in its contemporary fantasy setting.In many instances, the Umbral realm offers more of a challenge than that of the Axiom so that second chance might wind up going even worse than the original life.A long time coming, Lords of the Fallen is finally nearing completion and gearing up for a launch in just a few short months.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Every generation of Paramount executives harbors a desire to get a do-over on Kirk and Spock in the hope their name recognition alone will carry a series.The fact he\u2019s unable to make a decision in the cliffhanger is entirely congruent with the journey Pike has been on, but it\u2019s clear the steps leading to this moment would have been explored far more had Mount been available.That\u2019s why the emotional beats of Spock\u2019s dramatic rescue of Chapel worked perfectly, but asking the question of her survival did not.He also knows he has to remain true to his principles or else he could pollute the timeline and not be in the right place to save future Spock\u2019s life.Since then, however, more or less every episode has improved upon the last to produce a second season with barely any weak notes.The powers that be at Paramount didn\u2019t signal ahead of time that this episode would end on a cliffhanger.One that Kirk didn\u2019t have, which made him a better leader to take the Enterprise on its next set of missions.But go too far the other way and you make Pike a dove in comparison with the more hawkish Kirk which, to me, feels like the wrong message to be sending.\u201cAmong the Lotus Eaters\u201d saw Ortegas feeling sidelined after getting bumped from an away team which forced her to accept her role as the ship\u2019s pilot.Her scene with Dr. M'Benga, where she admits she\u2019s leaving the role of action hero to the captain, underscores this.But I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s something people would actually want?Bloody hell.And I know that\u2019s something of a minority opinion compared to all those folks who want yet another run on the nostalgia treadmill set in the safety of Trek\u2019s past.7.Two-fisted thinking men of action as comfortable on the back of a horse as they were quoting poetry or discussing naval history.Michael Gibson/Paramount+\n8.It\u2019s gratifying to see an actual, Paisley-born Scot playing the role, and an amusing fact that he\u2019s the second actor  \u2013 after Simon Pegg \u2013 who has paid their dues playing roles in various British comedy shows.But Anson Mount\u2019s paternity leave and reduced shooting schedule meant there wasn\u2019t time to examine the fallout from \u201cA Quality of Mercy\u201d in any detail.Back in the \u201860s, Pike and Kirk were the same character with the serial numbers filed off, both drawn from the same template of rugged mid \u201860s masculinity.3.It\u2019s not great that Strange New Worlds can only do so much to put clear water between Pike and Kirk.We don\u2019t need to whisper anything now, Strange New Worlds is the best live-action Trek of the streaming era.Michael Gibson/Paramount+\n6.The following article discusses spoilers for \u201cHegemony\u201d and Star Trek more generally.\u201cHegemony,\u201d then, is the show\u2019s first real chance to look at how Pike has tried to grow into Kirk\u2019s mold, despite how ill-fitting he finds it.This lack of distinction wasn\u2019t really an issue back then, or even now, until Strange New Worlds made the conscious decision to let Kirk lurk on the periphery of Pike\u2019s narrative.I\u2019m not sure I do, but then my dream would be an original series set in Trek\u2019s present with no legacy characters at all.\u201cHegemony,\u201d is a finale that, aided by the early commission of season three, acts as one part victory lap and one part set up for what follows.You can\u2019t make Pike look too old-fashioned or useless without alienating him from the audience, especially given his forthcoming ultimate sacrifice.Strange New Worlds has been smarter about setting up and paying off its threads than you might expect.At the end of my season one finale review, I wrote  \u201cWhisper it, friends, but Strange New Worlds might actually be good?\u201d That was a fair line at the time, since the show took a while before clicking into a high gear.I guess it was just too tempting not to follow up on that this time, with Martin Quinn as the young engineer.It\u2019s those two competing urges that paralyze Pike in the finale, knowing there are lives on the line whatever he does.And the first season finale made it clear that Pike\u2019s reluctance to shoot first and ask questions later was his tragic flaw.The team has raised their floor and ceiling in equal measure, and even the worst episode was bad because of what it said, not because of how it said it.In fact, Henry Alonso Myers\u2019 screenplay is a brilliant feint, suggesting the episode will wrap up on a satisfactory, if brisk, ending before the rug pull in its final moment.It meant the production team needed to retrofit Pike as different from his successor, helped by Anson Mount\u2019s gravitas and easy charm.2.9.You\u2019d be forgiven for not noticing the different transporter energy when the survivors were beamed away on your first watch.Michael Gibson/Paramount+\n4.It may bend the edges of Trek\u2019s established narrative but Strange New Worlds can never escape its eventual destination.Here, she finally gets her wish to go on a mission, but her initial enthusiasm is sapped when she realizes she\u2019s more or less out of her depth.Montgomery Scott\u2019s voice-only cameo in last season\u2019s finale was a neat hat-tip to fans with a basic fluency for Star Trek.I don\u2019t want to harp on about the limitations a prequel imposes, because we all know the score now.In his first talk with Admiral April, he advocates a policy of shooting first, but not long after he\u2019s thinking about trying to find a peaceful solution.Young Kirk, Young Spock, Young Uhura, Young Chapel, Young Scotty and Young Dr. M\u2019Benga will all be here, around and alive, to turn into their 1966 counterparts.(Notice she also gets to do an EVA in a proper spacesuit after her emergency leap in \u201cThe Broken Circle.\u201d) But I can only speak as a \u201cfan\u201d so maybe it worked better for those mainstream viewers who have made Strange New Worlds one of the biggest shows on streaming TV.You could easily argue it never needs to end so much as just swap out characters until you\u2019ve rebuilt the 1966 ensemble.The show was smart enough to only leave the issue lingering for the first act before we saw Chapel working to stay alive.1.But, again, you have to praise the production team for trusting the audience will keep up with what happened in the previous season.After all, he now knows his desire to find a peaceful solution single-handedly started a war that wiped out the Federation.You can\u2019t put any of those characters in jeopardy, or base your episode around asking that question, because we already know who is safe.The fact she\u2019s one of the crewmembers taken by the Gorn at the end adds a darker weight to her finally getting her wish granted.It\u2019s hard to know how long Strange New Worlds will run for, or what the plans are for its future.The cast and crew are working as a seamless whole, knowing that the conviction at which you sell is just as important as the quality of what\u2019s being sold.Myers\u2019 script and Maja Vrvilo\u2019s direction is permeated with a low-level feeling of dread that suits the needs of both the Alien-esque horror and the raised-stakes of a finale.If Quinn hangs around, I can\u2019t wait for Trek completionists to watch Limmy\u2019s Show and Derry Girls to watch his early work, much like when I watched Brent Spiner on Cheers and Night Court.5.(If nothing else, at least Strange New Worlds has kept its fan service to a minimum and tried, as best as it can, to set out on its own path.)I\u2019ve repeatedly said that Strange New Worlds exudes a special sort of confidence this season.",

expensive as you would expect.And, since the mic here sounds pretty clear with limited background noise retention, the volume and sidetone adjustments available in iCue are more than enough for me.That isn\u2019t to say it isn\u2019t a good sounding entry.For this specifically, I spent some time running in Hogwarts Legacy, in which I could easily place voices and sound events as they approached or passed by.I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the spatial audio.(Image credit: Future / James Holland)Cushy ear pads covered in a soft fabric round out \u00a0that comfortable fit, allowing hours of wear without issue.But, it still has plenty to offer such as quality surround sound performance and a comfortable fit.Instead of manually setting different EQ sliders, you essentially go through a five-minute test that analyzes what you can actually hear and adjusts accordingly.By using a suspended headband design, Corsair made it easy to adjust the tightness of the fit.The rest \u00a0of its features, which are worth exploring, are found on the iCue app.There\u2019s a ten-band EQ, which is much more powerful than what I see available in a lot of companion apps, along with some EQ presets.I typically don\u2019t care about EQing or throwing effects on my voice.The RGB zones on either ear cup and the LED ring on the end of the mic provide the only shock of color.While the majority of the Corsair HS80 Max seems to be made of hard and admittedly durable plastic, the headband is reinforced with lightweight aluminum.And, if there\u2019s one thing the Corsair HS80 Max is not, it\u2019s neutral.That\u2019s not to say this is a bad sounding headset.The downside to that is it\u2019s not the most detailed sounding headset out there, even in its price range.There\u2019s just a power button and volume wheel behind the left ear cup while a Bluetooth button sits behind the right.It\u2019s not going to make your eyes water like the Audeze Maxwell just by looking at the price tag, but it won\u2019t quite feel like a deal like the Corsair HS65 Surround.And if it were to be considered among the best gaming headsets available right now, it would probably be because of those extras.The headband does have a bit \u00a0more clamping force than I would like, but that\u2019s easily remedied.Read our full Corsair HS65 Surround review\u00a0How I tested the Corsair HS80 Max WirelessUsed regularly for three daysTested with all sorts of games as well as music and streaming videoTested all included featuresI used the Corsair HS80 Max Wireless Gaming Headset regularly for three days.The last thing I want to mention is the battery life.If you use the 2.4GHz wireless connection with RGB on, the Corsair HS80 Max will give 24 hours of use.It\u2019s also pretty comfortable, though the mic doesn\u2019t have any background noise rejection.You can also install Nvidia Broadcast (if you have a compatible GPU) \u00a0for any deep adjustments to the mic, but it\u2019s not necessary.Read our full Alienware AW720H review\u00a0Corsair HS65 Surround \nThe Corsair HS65 Surround is cheap.The only real issue that could possibly get in the way of comfort is the fact that hard headband can\u2019t actually be extended.After having spent some time with the HS80 Max, I\u2019d say that price tag is well-earned as it offers an appropriate amount of performance, comfort, and features for what Corsair is asking.Of course, competition is stiff at this price point.The only control for the mic is its ability to mute when flipped up.That volume wheel contains a secret function, though.In fact, it sounds good.(Image credit: Future / James Holland)Before I get too into the sound quality, I do want to add a quick caveat that I can be a harsh critic in this department.Corsair HS80 Max Wireless: Two-minute reviewThe Corsair HS80 Max is a gaming headset that leads not with its audio quality but with its feature set.Price: 4 / 5Corsair

but the best thing about it are all the features on offer.4 / 5Buy it if...You want all the features\nWith one notable exception, the Corsair HS80 Max has all the features you could want, from a remappable button and multiple forms of wireless connectivity to a personalized sound signature and spatial audio.You want something for long gaming sessions\nComfort and battery life are two crucial elements to any headset, and they\u2019re well-implemented here, meaning you can get in a good, long gaming session and be none the worse for wear.Don't buy it if...You care most about sound quality\nWhile the Corsair HS80 Max sounds good, it\u2019s a filtered sound with a low-mid boost and high-end rolloff that won\u2019t quite knock your socks off.You have a big head\nIf you have a big head (and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that!That means you can unfasten the fabric to loosen it almost like shoe laces.While the Corsair HS80 Max is not incredibly wide, it offers a good amount of space and delivers precise placement of sound elements.But, it\u2019s got a boost in the low-mids with the highs slightly rolled for a sound that is best described as warm.Just be aware that it\u2019s a wired headset.While wearing it for hours at a time, I used it with a number of games including Gotham Knights, Control, Far Cry 6, and Hogwarts Legacy.The Corsair HS65 Surround, mentioned above, goes for just $79 / \u00a379 / AU$119 and offers good surround sound and a comfortable fit, though you will have to forgo that wireless connectivity.After all, it\u2019s the core function of every headset and pair of headphones, and I tend to prefer more neutral sounding sound signatures.I also listened to all sorts of genres of music and did a little video streaming as well.While using the headset, I tested all the settings in the iCue software, toggling the various EQ settings as well as Dolby Atmos audio and other features such as the SoundID Personalization, comparing the results to get a better understanding of the headset.Since I\u2019ve reviewed audio equipment from speakers to headsets and headphones for the last few years, I\u2019ve been able to build and use my expertise towards giving an honest and fair opinion, not to mention a critical ear, to any audio product I test.Read more about how we testFirst reviewed August 2023(Image credit: Future / James Holland)In terms of its design, it doesn\u2019t stray from Corsair\u2019s previous HS80 gaming headset, with that version\u2019s almost boxy ear cups, suspended headband, flip-to-mute mic copied and pasted into this updated version.When pressed, it opens the iCue app (more on that later) that gives you access to a host of commands from changing EQ profiles \u2013 or alternately, performs non-headset commands like launching a program or simulating a button press on a mouse or key press on a keyboard.$179.99 / \u00a3169.99 / AU$299When is it available?Just unfasten the end of the fabric band held in place by velcro, adjust to taste, and refasten.The Alienware AW720H offers crisp, Hi-Res audio and that could-have-been-designed-at-Pixar look that sets it apart, though the mic and battery life here is better.If that almost $180 / \u00a3170 price point is too steep, Corsair does offer some good alternatives.Available in the US, UK, and AustraliaAt $179.99 / \u00a3169.99 / AU$299, the Corsair HS80 Max is the epitome of mid-range.However, it is pleasant to listen to and actually performs better with games than with music (video streaming sits somewhere in between) as that low-mid boost helps approximate some rumble and gives body to any sound details, whether it\u2019s the sound of running footsteps or explosions in Far Cry 6 or the thud of hitting against a shield in Gotham Knights.Just as important as the actual sound quality is the soundstage and imaging.At 352 grams, it\u2019s not the lightest headsetI\u2019ve experienced, but it\u2019s light enough.The only reason I\u2019m not singing its praises as much as the feature set is the fact that most current gaming headsets have pretty good battery life, and if you regularly charge when not in use, you probably won\u2019t notice the difference as much.However, turn the RGB off, and you can get up to 65, and that\u2019s where it starts to get impressive.While I\u2019ve generally found this kind of personalization feature to apply drastic changes to the EQ settings (which I didn\u2019t like), I appreciated that the feature implemented here created a very usable and more subtle personalized sound signature.iCue also lets you play with the RGB and create different profiles to adjust mic settings.It\u2019s a nice feature that I personally wouldn\u2019t rely on too much, but it can give a little more depth to those who need it.As I\u2019ve mentioned before, it\u2019s the features that I think are what make this headset special.Taking it a step further there\u2019s also a way to create a personalized EQ or sound profile via the Sonarworks SoundID personalization.It comes in either black or white / gray colorways for a slightly muted look.Available nowWhere can you get it?It verges on subtle but does give a little more space to game audio without washing it out the way some spatial audio can.The yolks attached to the ear cups are also made of aluminum, ensuring that one of the most fragile elements of a headset will endure whatever wear and tear you\u2019re putting it through.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Future / James Holland)(Image credit: Future / James Holland)The comfort is spot on as well.And of course, the comfort and battery life are very good as well, with it outlasting many of the best wireless gaming headsets with its RGB lighting still on.But it\u2019s the extras that really sell it: there\u2019s a customizable button for on-the-fly controls, a relatively powerful EQ, and a way to create a completely customized sound profile.There are a couple omissions, most notably multipoint connectivity, but the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to its feature set is more than enough to recommend it.So, if you have a particularly big head, this might not be the headset for you.Physical controls are pretty minimal.On sound quality alone, it\u2019s capable but not necessarily the most appealing option out there in its price range.The aforementioned ability to map the Scroll Press to a whole set of functions is one of them.The Corsair HS80 Max supports Dolby Atmos, accessible through the Dolby Access app, for that three dimensional sound.It also has both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connectivity so you can connect it to a ton of different platforms, though sadly it doesn\u2019t have multipoint connectivity.",

            "paraphrased_content": "In fact, more than once, as I was using the Z Fold 5 in tablet mode, I remembered I needed to send a text or respond to a message and thought to myself, \u201cI need to go get my phone.\u201d It\u2019s a neat moment when you remember that the device in your hands isn\u2019t just a big screen for playing games and doing your Spanish lessons \u2014 it\u2019s also the thing you use to text your mom.The 7.6-inch inner display is the same size and almost square shape as last year\u2019s screen.Related: Samsung owes me restitution for the Duolingo question that I blew because I hit the enter key when I was aiming for the backspace.Samsung isn\u2019t pushing the envelope here \u2014 it\u2019s nudging it forward by the tiniest margin.It\u2019s still IPX8 rated, with the \u201c8\u201d signifying resistance against full water immersion and the \u201cX\u201d marking a big \u201cnope\u201d for dust resistance.It\u2019s the same triple rear camera array that Samsung\u2019s been using in the past couple of generations of S-series phones, with a 50-megapixel stabilized main camera, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto, and a 12-megapixel ultrawide.Even with all of these multitasking and big-screen experiences at your disposal, the Z Fold 5\u2019s battery can last a full day of heavy use without requiring a midday recharge.Hello, big screen.And that\u2019s about it.Samsung may still have the lead in the foldable race, but the gap is closing.I can set up a multi-window view with Instagram on one half and the other split between Slack and a timer to keep an eye on work messages while I\u2019m taking a break.And it does \u2014 overall, it\u2019s the better foldable phone.For example, Samsung\u2019s Weather app also has its own privacy policy that may include sharing information with\u00a0weather.com.Final tally: there are five mandatory agreements and at least ten optional ones.There\u2019s still no dust resistance, it\u2019s still a relatively heavy device, and at $1,800, it still costs a small fortune.I managed over five hours of screen-on time and still had about 10 percent left by bedtime.These things are just not currently possible on the Google Pixel Fold, and they\u2019re the kinds of features that really make the Fold 5\u2019s big inner screen sing.It handled about half an hour of gaming and some lighter tasks without warming up to the point of impacting performance.Not really.If you use a carrier-specific version, there will be more of them.Just be prepared to pay up.It still feels a little like using a TV remote as a phone\n\nThe Fold 5 is dense when it\u2019s closed, and using it folded closed for a long time can get a bit uncomfortable \u2014 I notice the weight on my pinky finger more than when I use a typical slab-style phone.It also looks objectively ridiculous when I carry it in the side pocket of my yoga pants.I think there is a significant subset of people interested in a folding phone that would be happier with the Pixel.Generally, it is.Photography by Allison Johnson\n\nAgree to continue: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads.The crease is no more or less pronounced than it was on the Fold 4, and you generally don\u2019t see it when you\u2019re using the phone unfolded.Have you seen the mobile web Gmail interface recently?\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no los dos?There\u2019s a 4-megapixel under-display camera on the inside that\u2019s passable for video calls as long as you\u2019re in a well-lit location.You still can\u2019t select more than one email.These are all major barriers when you consider that any current slab-style flagship will be lighter, more durable, and cost at least $600 less than the Fold 5.The Galaxy Z Fold 5 is often more powerful than the mobile ecosystem it lives in\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 5 is often more powerful than

screen for extended periods of time, but I never experienced the same oh-shit-I-better-recharge-now battery anxiety I felt after a morning of heavy use with the Pixel Fold.Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nThe Fold 5\u2019s camera hardware is just okay, which is fine until you remember that this is a $1,800 phone.Those aren\u2019t huge differences, but they\u2019re important ones when you\u2019re talking about a folding phone you\u2019ll want to get the most out of.The Pixel Fold doesn\u2019t come with a show-stopping camera array, either, but at least you get a 5x telephoto lens.If you weren\u2019t convinced by the Fold 4, then you shouldn\u2019t feel any differently about the Fold 5.This was just one of those scenarios where the Z Fold 5 is equipped to handle more than the typical mobile app allows \u2014 a not-infrequent occurrence.For the rest of us mere mortals, 4K and 1080p clips look plenty detailed and vibrant.But to its credit, the Z Fold 5 is appreciably lighter than the Pixel Fold and a bit more comfortable to use when it\u2019s closed.The Fold 5 \u2014 like the Fold 4 \u2014 is an impressive little machine.PreviousNext1/11PreviousNext1/11\n\nAt times, it\u2019s excellent, particularly if you like your colors on the punchy side.It\u2019s more of an aesthetic effect than anything.There are more multitasking options and ways to take advantage of that big inner screen, and battery life is better.But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate.To use the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 or Z Flip 5, you must agree to:Samsung\u2019s Terms and ConditionsSamsung\u2019s Privacy PolicyGoogle Terms of Service (including Privacy Policy)Google Play Terms of ServiceAutomatic installs (including from Google, Samsung, and your carrier)There are many optional agreements.The outer screen\u2019s long and skinny dimensions are roughly the same as on the Fold 4, which is to say it still feels a little like using a TV remote as a phone.At least in terms of software, the Fold 5 is built to go the distance: it\u2019ll get four years of OS upgrades and five years of security updates \u2014 that\u2019s one more OS upgrade than Google promises for the Pixel Fold.It\u2019s 13 grams heavier than an iPhone 14 Pro Max \u2014 a hefty device in its own right \u2014 and a full 80 grams heavier than a standard iPhone 14.It\u2019s meaningfully lighter, which makes a difference when you\u2019re using it folded for long periods of time.The tablet configuration of the Gmail app looks great on the Z Fold 5\u2019s inner screen \u2014 two columns with a lovely modern UI when you rotate the phone to landscape.It\u2019s not just the weight, either \u2014 it\u2019s how that weight is distributed.Samsung\u2019s processing is often prone to the cardboard cutout look, especially with the wide-angle lens, but its telephoto portraits in good lighting are second to none.If you prefer Google\u2019s photo processing over Samsung\u2019s or you strongly dislike the tall-and-narrow form factor of the Fold 5 when it\u2019s closed, then you might be better off with the Pixel Fold.Or 2.4mm, to be exact.Removing the number row and making the keyboard taller helps a little, but that only makes the keys about as big as they are on an iPhone 13 Mini.It\u2019s easy to measure the difference between the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 and the Z Fold 5: two millimeters.For now, though, that\u2019s just enough.Multitasking is seamless, and Samsung has spent the past few years engineering clever little software workarounds to help the phone contend with a mobile world built for smaller screens.If it wants to stay ahead, it\u2019ll have to do more next year than just nip a few millimeters and pop in a new chipset.We\u2019re no longer just measuring Samsung\u2019s new foldable phone against the old one \u2014 it needs to compete with the Google Pixel Fold.7Verge ScoreSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 5$1797.99The GoodPowerful multitasking features with a sleek inner screen experienceNew hinge folds flatGood software support policy, including four OS upgradesThe BadStill expensiveStill chunky and relatively heavyLong-term durability is still uncertain$1800 at Samsung$1800 at Amazon$1798 at Best BuyHow we rate and review products\n\nOf course, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 is also entering the chat with one thing the Fold 4 didn\u2019t have at launch: meaningful competition.The long-and-narrow outer screen doesn\u2019t offer the best typing experience.Samsung may still have the lead in the foldable race, but the gap is closing\n\nOverall, though, the Fold 5 comes out just ahead.At its thickest point, last year\u2019s Z Fold 4 measures 15.8mm when folded \u2014 the Z Fold 5 uses a new hinge to fold totally flat and measures 13.4mm thick.Video recording is available at up to 8K/24p, which is cool if you have any way of looking at 8K video in your life.Has anyone at Google seen the mobile web Gmail interface recently?It\u2019s ugly as sin, and guess what?Samsung says it\u2019s working on dustproofing its future models, and that would be a welcome development indeed.But for Samsung\u2019s very latest and greatest camera hardware, you\u2019ll have to look at the Galaxy S23 Ultra, which is a full $500 cheaper.Don\u2019t yell at me to open your app, Google.With moderate use on other days, I usually had around 40 percent left in the tank.Outside of that, there aren\u2019t any other durability improvements to report.In the meantime, long-term durability is still a bit of a question mark, and using a folding phone in a dusty environment isn\u2019t a great idea.Does that make a noticeable difference in using the phone?But the fact is, multitasking on the big screen was already pretty damn good, and it remains so on the Fold 5.And even on a hot day in peak patio season, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset powering the Fold 5 didn\u2019t get too warm.I can also save this configuration to the homescreen, taskbar, or app side panel, so I can access it again quickly.It\u2019s a bit lighter, the inside screen gets a bit brighter, and it includes this year\u2019s flagship Qualcomm processor.Is the Fold 5 thinner and lighter than the Fold 4?I notice this most frequently when I\u2019m typing \u2014 I have to concentrate harder than usual on tapping the right keys since they\u2019re so narrow.It\u2019s certainly not the phone that will truly take foldables into the mainstream.It now offers a peak brightness of 1750 nits, so it\u2019s easy to use even in direct sunlight, something the Pixel Fold struggles with \u2014 and, speaking from experience, definitely bright enough to use while sitting on the shaded patio of your favorite coffee shop.The gapless wonder.Technically, yes.You\u2019ll find no cutting-edge camera tech here.For most people, it\u2019s probably not better than any of the countless slab-style phones you can buy for much less.But open up the Z Fold 5, and you\u2019ll see why it\u2019s still ahead, despite Google\u2019s best efforts.A few more taps and my inbox was squeaky clean.So I switched to desktop mode, and it worked great.If you\u2019re attached to the idea of using your phone in one hand, then this probably isn\u2019t the device for you.But it\u2019s mostly a winner by default; it\u2019s good because the Z Fold 4 was already good.RelatedSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 review: the flip phone we\u2019ve been waiting forSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 series review: refined, but not revolutionaryGoogle Pixel Fold review: closing the gap\n\nThe Fold 5\u2019s new hinge certainly looks nicer, and Samsung says its design will handle impacts better than the previous one.Work on your Spanish or browse Spotify?Calling the Galaxy Z Fold 5 a better phone than the Fold 4 feels like a stretch \u2014 it\u2019s marginally better at most.And I\u2019ll take Samsung\u2019s portrait mode over the Pixel\u2019s every time.That\u2019s not to say that the Z Fold 5 is miles ahead of the Pixel Fold \u2014 the Pixel\u2019s camera is stronger overall, and its landscape-first orientation has advantages over the portrait-oriented Z Fold 5.Samsung\u2019s software updates are incredibly minor \u2014 it\u2019s easier to drag and drop content from one app to another or organize the apps on your homescreen.To its credit, the Fold 5 is significantly lighter than the Pixel Fold, but it\u2019s still a chunky, relatively heavy device.The more interesting question is whether the Z Fold 5 is a better phone than the Pixel Fold.I get up early most days to sort out my schedule, and one of the great joys with a cup of coffee on Monday morning is bulk deleting emails from my Gmail promotions tab.So I went to Chrome and encountered\u2026 this screen.It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.The weight is better distributed with the phone open, but that\u2019s a two-handed affair for sure.Pixel image processing is more consistent and predictable, too, and the Fold 5 comes with all the quirks I\u2019ve come to expect from Samsung\u2019s photo processing.Here are just a few:Sending diagnostic data to SamsungSamsung services, including customization for personalized ads, continuity service, nearby device scanning, and smart suggestionsGoogle Drive backup, location services, Wi-Fi scanning, diagnostic dataBixby privacy policy (required to use Bixby), plus optional for Bixby options like personalized content, data access, and audio recording reviewThere may be more.But you can\u2019t tap a checkbox to select all of the messages in an individual Gmail tab the way you can on the desktop interface, which is a problem when you want to yeet 500 promotional emails into the trash at once.It\u2019s especially noticeable when you\u2019re using the cover screen with the phone closed for, you know, normal phone stuff.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Rather than registering a keypress at a set actuation point, Rapid Trigger instead registers it the moment the keyboard detects any kind of downward movement, which is theoretically much quicker.It also advertises a polling rate of \u201cup to 8,000Hz,\u201d which is eight times higher than what keyboards typically offer and should result in lower input latency.Unlike Razer, Corsair\u2019s keyboards scan for keypresses at a slower 4,000Hz before reporting them to a connected computer at this maximum 8,000Hz, but in practice, I\u2019ve never noticed any difference in input latency.But given my experience with the Wooting Two HE, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge miss.In contrast, traditional mechanical switches rely on two metal contacts coming together to register a press, while optical switches spot when a switch stem gets in the way of a beam of infrared light.Photo by Jon Porter / The VergeThe keyboard\u2019s USB-C cable is detachable.Image: Corsair\n\nAlongside the K70 Max keyboard, Corsair is also announcing a new $179.99 headset, the HS80 Max Premium Wireless RGB.Photo by Jon Porter / The VergeA volume roller and media keys can be found on the top right of the keyboard.Corsair is making use of this capability in a couple of different ways.Here\u2019s a typing sound test:\n\nHere\u2019s what typing sounds like on the Corsair K70 Max with MGX switches:\n\n\nHere\u2019s what typing sounds like on the Corsair K70 Max with MGX switches(opens a new window)\n\nThe Corsair HS80 Max Premium Wireless RGB.The company is branding the switches as \u201cCorsair MGX\u201d to distinguish them from its existing optical mechanical OPX switches and keyboards with standard mechanical Cherry MX switches.The basic idea is that each switch has a magnet inside its stem.Additional buttons offer dedicated backlight controls and more.Photo by Jon Porter / The VergeOf course, there\u2019s RGB lighting aplenty.Second, Corsair\u2019s software lets users set two actions to a single switch, so a half-press can do one thing, but a full press can do another.Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nBeyond its MGX switches, the Corsair K70 Max is very similar to the company\u2019s existing lineup of K70 keyboards.Press the switch, and a Hall effect sensor in the PCB under the switch can sense that the magnet has gotten closer and register a keypress.Photo by Jon Porter / The VergeThe keyboard\u2019s USB-C cable is detachable.You might want something close to the former when playing twitchy games where speed is of the essence or the latter to minimize accidental keypresses while typing.Photo by Jon Porter / The VergeOf course, there\u2019s RGB lighting aplenty.Battery life is rated at up to 65 hours via the dongle and 130 hours over Bluetooth.The feature, which is also available for Wooting\u2019s Hall effect keyboards, won\u2019t be available at launch for the K70 Max, but Corsair spokesperson Justin Ocbina says it\u2019ll be released via a firmware update before the end of the month.First, it\u2019ll allow users to customize the exact point when one of its MGX switches actuates (read: registers a keypress) from anywhere between an ultra-responsive 0.4mm to a full 3.6mm (the default is 2mm).Image: Corsair\n\nThe advantage of this magnetic approach is that it\u2019s inherently analog, meaning the Hall effect sensor can tell whether a switch has been pressed a little bit or a lot.I\u2019ve been testing Corsair\u2019s new $229.99 K70 Max mechanical keyboard for the last few days \u2014 its first to use magnetic Hall effect sensors to register keypresses, allowing for new features like the ability to customize how far you have to press a key before it registers a keypress.This would allow each key to emulate analog input methods like an analog stick, throttle, or trigger to \u2014 for example \u2014 give you granular control over a car\u2019s acceleration when playing a racing game.Photo by Jon Porter / The VergeA volume roller and media keys can be found on the top right of the keyboard.The company advertises that the headset is compatible with PC, Mac, and PlayStation consoles via its 2.4GHz dongle and can also connect to additional devices via Bluetooth.A third feature is one Corsair\u2019s calling \u201cRapid Trigger,\u201d and it\u2019s designed to make the keyboard more responsive when pressing the same key repeatedly.Corsair\u2019s Hall effect MGX switch.The keyboard comes with a six-foot detachable USB-C to USB-A cable, and there are a couple of extra keycaps and a keycap puller included in the box.Manufacturers like SteelSeries and Wooting have been making keyboards equipped with Hall effect sensors for a few years now.It uses a full-size layout that includes additional shortcut keys, media controls, and a programmable volume roller.Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nAdditional buttons offer dedicated backlight controls and more.Around top, you\u2019ll find Corsair\u2019s standard \u201ctournament switch,\u201d which is designed to be used during competitive play and disables any recorded macros or distracting flashing backlighting.Despite its premium price, in terms of typing feel quality, the K70 Max isn\u2019t a serious competitor to Keychron\u2019s $199 Q1 Pro or even its more affordable $84 V1.This is a gaming keyboard through and through, and while I\u2019ve been using it for office work this past week, I\u2019ve found it to sound quite hollow and rattly, without the smooth crispness of Keychron\u2019s competing models.Alongside it, the company is also announcing a new headset: the HS80 Max Premium Wireless RGB.The reality is that the vast majority of PC games aren\u2019t designed with analog keyboards in mind, which can lead to games getting confused when they receive an analog button input while being controlled primarily with a keyboard and mouse.What Corsair isn\u2019t doing with the K70 Max is offering full analog control like we\u2019ve seen with previous Wooting or Razer keyboards.",

            "paraphrased_content": "(Image credit: Shutterstock)Disney's price hikes are sure to anger fans who use one or both of their primary streaming platforms.That'll make its price rises slightly more palatable, even if you and I don't agree with them.As of May 2023 (per The Verge), five million people had opened Netflix accounts on its cheapest plan.Beginning September 6, Disney will roll out a new bundle called Duo Premium, which will give customers access to Disney Plus and Hulu's non-ad-supported tiers for $19.99 a month.(Image credit: Hulu)That's where Disney comes in.Keeping its ads-supported tier at just $7.99 per month in the US, too, is Disney's way of ensuring its offering a cost-effective plan to those on a budget.Even so, I can't help but feel these price increases, plus the roll out of Disney Plus' ads subscription in Canada and Europe, are unwarranted, particularly as families struggle to make ends meet, and the ongoing writers and actors strikes rumble on.The total number of users who have joined Disney Plus via its ads-supported subscription stood at 3.3 million by July 1 (i.e.the end of Disney's Q3 2023 period).Clearly, Disney feels it can convince even more people to fork over their hard-earned cash and open an account on its Standard with Ads tier \u2013 that's why it's rolling out the scheme to more nations.Beginning November 1, new users can sign up to this plan for \u00a310.99 a month / \u00a3109.90 a year, and gain access to the same features as US subscribers at this tier level.\"We've raised prices in nearly 50 countries around the world to better reflect the value of our product offerings,\" Iger said.According to Disney's CEO, 40% of new Disney Plus subscribers (in the US) have signed up for its Standard with Ads plan.The tier supporting ads isn't available as a yearly subscription, either.Taking the ads-based tier fight to NetflixIs Netflix partly to blame for Disney Plus rolling out its ads-based tier worldwide?That's a tiny fraction of the company's 238 million-strong fanbase, but it proves that Netflix's plan to make its service more affordable (and enticing) to everyone is working.The Bear is one of Disney Plus and Hulu's best-rated TV shows.Sure, people are happy to pay money for top-tier content including The Bear, Guardians of the Galaxy 3, and Avatar 2.Disney has announced it's raising the price of its main Disney Plus and Hulu tiers \u2013 and it seems Netflix is to blame.Confirmed in a press release after the company's Q3 2023 earnings call, Disney Plus and Hulu's most expensive subscriptions are going up in price.The changes will come into affect on October 12.But it's not all bad news for customers who want to subscribe to two of the world's best streaming services.In fact, I'd go as far as to say that it's Netflix's fault that Disney has implemented these changes.We all know that Netflix rolled out its own ads-based plan \u2013 dubbed Basic with Ads \u2013 in November 2022 as a way of coercing those on a budget to sign up to its platform.But, if you're not delivering must-see content to subscribers, people won't have an incentive to sign up.However, no yearly plan will be available to purchase.Hulu's non-ads-supported tier is going up in price.After all, if it wasn't successful, why give more users the choice to sign up to this plan?Even worse, current users could temporarily or permanently close their accounts.Like Netflix, then, Disney can't fall into the trap of making substandard films and TV series.Users can sign up to this plan for just \u00a34.99 a month.Unlike the Premium and Standard tiers, though, Disney Plus' ads-supported plan won't let users download the best Disney Plus shows and best Disney Plus movies to watch on the move.Additionally, Standard and Ads-paying customers will only be able to stream at 1080p and on two devices.With Disney set to clamp down on password sharing on Disney Plus (and potentially Hulu) soon, offering a cheap plan to new customers will help them boost their userbase significantly, too.That's all well and good from a business perspective, especially if you're looking to stop bleeding money like Disney has done in recent years.Unfortunately, his answer won't be music to anyone's ears.But, if viewers don't think they're getting value for money \u2013 just look at the universally negative reaction to Secret Invasion, the latest Marvel TV show, for proof of that \u2013 Iger's comments will ring hollow and come across as nothing more than a soundbite to appease investors.Star Wars: Ahsoka joins Disney Plus' back catalog in late August.If if fails, however, the alternative doesn't bear thinking about \u2013 for Disney or for subscribers who stick around and may have to deal with further price increases down the line.For more Disney Plus and Hulu coverage, read our guides on the best Hulu shows, best Hulu movies, and new Disney Plus movies.Today's best Disney Plus and  Hulu dealsDisney+ Monthly\u00a37.99/mthViewat Disney+Disney+ Yearly\u00a379.90/yearViewat Disney+Meanwhile, Hulu without ads will increase from $14.99 to $17.99 a month.Disney Plus Premium, which allows users to stream in 4K and watch the service simultaneously on four screens, is rising from $10.99 to $13.99 per month / $109.99 to $139.99 a year in the US (more on UK pricing below).Existing customers will remain on their current subscription, but will have the option to switch to the streamer's Standard (for \u00a37.99 a month / \u00a379.90 a year) or Standard with Ads subscription schemes.Speaking of the ads-supported tier, Disney will finally roll this out on British shores on November 1, too.It needs to give us great shows like Only Murders in the Building, or excite us with highly anticipated offerings, including the forthcoming Star Wars: Ahsoka and Loki season 2.The introduction of Disney Plus' ads-based tier \u2013 one month after Netflix launched its own scheme, remember \u2013 has been viewed as a success by Iger and company.(Image credit: Disney/Lucasfilm)Disney will argue, though, that the introduction of its ads-based plan in the UK (and other countries, including Canada, France, and Germany) will give customers a cheaper tier to subscribe to.The entertainment giant only raised the price of Disney Plus in December 2022, so the prospect of paying more \u2013 particularly during a cost of living crisis \u2013 will be a bitter pill for users to swallow.Defending the company's decision to raise prices during its Q3 2023 earnings call (thanks to The Motley Fool for the transcript), Disney CEO Bob Iger explained why customers were being asked to pay more.(Image credit: Shutterstock)Meanwhile, in the UK, Disney will rebrand its most expensive tier to

            "paraphrased_content": "We were shown some concept videos of people making video calls and watching movies using the headset, but nothing that really justified the huge $3,499 (around \u00a32,815 / AU$5,290) price tag that it will launch with.What we need is a killer app that makes the Vision Pro a must-by.But you know what?This would open up huge possibilities, as you\u2019d be able to run full programs and games on the headset.So far, we\u2019ve not had that, but an app that allows an almost unlimited amount of applications could be the key \u2013 and would also showcase Apple\u2019s vision for \u2018spatial computing\u2019, which is how the company refers to the tech powering the Vision Pro \u2013 which includes hardware such as the same M2 chip found in the best MacBooks, and the new R1 chip.The UTM app is certainly exciting, but I wouldn\u2019t get too excited just yet.PerhapsOne of the major questions many people \u2013 including myself \u2013 had when Apple showed off the Vision Pro, was what is the headset actually for?It actually is.As 9to5Mac reports (via iPhoneSoft), developers working on an early version of the visionOS operating system that the Vision Pro will run on, have managed to get an emulator running with a working version of Windows XP.In a video posted on X, the social media network formerly known as Twitter, which you can see below, Windows XP is shown loading in a big floating window in a lounge.UTM is now running on Vision Pro (simulator)!Still need to implement input devices but here's a sneak peek.pic.twitter.com/xYnSgTdXpiAugust 8, 2023See moreRoom with a viewWhile Windows XP is regarded as one of the better versions of Microsoft\u2019s operating system, the idea of it looming over you as you sit on your couch may seem like some sort of dystopian nightmare, but this is actually pretty cool.Sure, it\u2019s unlikely that I\u2019d want to fire up Windows XP to play some Minesweeper on a virtual 100-inch screen, this is an exciting demonstration on what could be possible for Vision Pro.The developers are working on UTM, an emulator that brings non-Apple software to iPhones, Macs and now, it seems, the Vision Pro.This emulation isn\u2019t yet perfect \u2013 there isn\u2019t a way to control Windows XP when it\u2019s running \u2013 but the team has time to work on that before the Vision Pro\u2019s official launch early next year.And, while Windows XP is shown off in this video, it does suggest that this could mean other operating systems could come to Vision Pro.When the Apple Vision Pro, the powerful and ultra-expensive VR headset, was shown off by CEO Tim Cook at WWDC 2023, few (if any) of us expected one of the most interesting showcases for the new tech to be running the ability to run a Windows operating system by arch nemesis Microsoft \u2013 especially one that was first released back in 2001.(Image credit: Apple)Killer app?As you may imagine, Apple won\u2019t be too keen on people running non-Apple software on the Vision Pro, so don\u2019t expect installing UTM on the headset to be as straightforward as downloading it from the built-in app store.It would be a shame if Apple hobbled the Vision Pro\u2019s potential by forcing a walled-garden approach to apps, like on the iPhone, where you can only officially install apps from Apple\u2019s own store, unlike the more open approach on Macs and Windows laptops.If Apple is serious about the Vision Pro being a productivity machine and the dawn of \u2018spatial computing\u2019, then it\u2019s going to have to be willing to give up some control \u2013 and it may not want to do that.",

            "paraphrased_content": "So, if you're in the market for a full-frame travel camera, it's definitely one to keep an eye on.In our Sony A7C review, we felt the camera's shooting experience was just too compromised to justify the price tag ($1,799.99 / \u00a31,850.00 / AU$2,399.00).Sony Alpha Rumors is pretty confident that the camera (plus an A7CR sibling, with the Sony A7R V's 61MP sensor) will be launched on August 29.Today's best Sony A7C deals\u00a31,899.99\u00a31,599View\u00a31,699View\u00a31,699ViewShow More DealsWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesLast year's Sony A7C fell frustratingly short of being the perfect compact, full-frame travel camera.(Image credit: Sony)The Sony A7C is a camera that divides opinion and we don't yet know if these A7C II rumors are completely accurate.Analysis: A charming camera that divides opinionThe Sony A7C (above) comes with compromises, but could offer better value if an A7C II successor does arrive soon.We noted that \"the EVF is clear enough in use, but the display is simply too small for a full-frame camera and is uncomfortable to use\".Video performance has also apparently been boosted to 10-bit 4K/60p with 10-bit color depth, plus support for the S-Cinetone color profile.From the video below, it looks like the mirrorless camera will add a new front dial, which is traditionally used to change the aperture.They suggest that the A7C II will be a relatively minor update that won't improve the camera's electronic viewfinder or ergonomics, which were our two main criticisms of the A7C.So what's new on the A7C II?That'll go down well with those who found the A7C's controls to be a bit limited.And, according to some new leaks, its imminent A7C II successor may soon arrive with some familiar flaws.The first leaked photos of the Sony A7C II appear to have landed, courtesy of Sony Alpha Rumors and the Chinese YouTuber Alex NG (below).The camera has found favor among street photographers who like its inconspicuous size and image quality, and the rumors suggest the A7C II could bring important video boosts, too.While the Sony A6700 offers a good alternative to the A7C, then, we'll be keeping an eye out for the expected A7C II announcement.Both of those would be an upgrade on the A7C for video shooters, as that current model tops out at 4K/30p, 8-bit video at 100Mbps.Unfortunately, the A7C II's viewfinder appears to be the same small, 2.36-million dot affair as before, which we found to be small and awkward to use, and there's no sign of an improved grip to help the A7C II balance better with longer lenses.Still, there are always going to be limitations and compromises with such a tiny full-frame camera (the A7C weighs just 509g).When you combine this with the small grip and the fact that the Sony A7 IV can now be found for less than its original $2,499 / \u00a32,400 / AU$$4,299 asking price, the A7C (and perhaps the A7C II) can be a compromise too far for many photographers and video shooters.Then again, the A7C is one of the world's smallest and lightest full-frame mirrorless cameras (only the Sigma fp and fp L beat it here), and that could be the most important factor for you.An improved mode dial also appears to separate the stills, video and S&Q (slow & quick) modes for easier access.But otherwise, the rumored specs suggest the A7C II could again fall just short of being the perfect, mini full-frame camera.On the plus side, the leaks suggest it'll get the Sony A7 IV's higher-resolution 33MP sensor (compared to the 24.2MP one on the A7C) and Sony's latest Bionz XR and AI processors, which are an excellent combination for snappy and reliable autofocus.So, if you can work with that viewfinder and are mainly planning to use compact, prime lenses, the A7C II could still be one to watch.",

cottage-core-loving girlfriend or something so it doesn\u2019t end up in the trash.Several of the lots being advertised \u2014 such as soundproof office booths and designer chairs \u2014 were also listed in an auction back in January.Most of these are decorative signs or wall art, but there\u2019s also an attractive wooden coffee table or a \u201cLarry art boulder\u201d for those who can spare the room.There\u2019s plenty of new stuff up for grabs though, and some of it toes the line between tragic and downright amusing.I guess?Image: X / Heritage Global Partners\n\nOkay, honestly this is

One of the things where I really pushed was that Avowed was going to be multiplayer, and I kept on that for a long time.However, as Justin Britch, head of development, goes on to say, this original focus came at the expense of how the studio approaches quests and dialogue.Known for quality single-player games, the idea that Avowed was originally penned, and being made, as a co-op game is quite the eyebrow-raiser.",

            "paraphrased_content": "There\u2019s not many form factors that can accommodate that many parts especially as they will consume more power.The 3.5-inch form factor (similar to the 100TB SSD from Nimbus Data) is a potential candidate as it allows straight-replacement for SATA/SAS based hard disk drives of the same size.Solidigm\u2019s excellent QLC-based D5-P5336 has proven that you can mix performance with capacity and low prices and I expect others - including Samsung - to follow.A 256TB SSD could replace a dozen hard disk drives like the Exos X20 although hard drive vendors would want hyperscalers to wait for their 26TB and 30TB hard drives to come to the market first before the latter cast their votes.The SSD is QLC based and designed for hyperscalers and enterprises; absolutely no mention of the elephant in the room, PLC (Penta level Cell).The press release says that \u201ccompared to stacking eight 32TB SSDs, one 256TB SSD consumes approximately seven times less power, despite storing the same amount of data\u201d.Time however is not on HDD manufacturer's side.So what could it be?Samsung has an 8th generation V-NAND with 236-layer and 1Tb capacity that was released in November 2022 and which the company claims had the highest bit density at the time.Elsewhere in the press release, Samsung has committed to support the 2.5-inch standard by delivering a new PCIe 5.0 SSD, the PM9D3a, in this form factor but with a 7.68TB/15.36TB capacity.It may be referring to the never-released 32TB SSD prototype it unveiled back in 2017.On the other hand, more recent form factors would help futureproof the design: Enterprise and Data Center Standard Form Factor (EDSFF) such as E1.L and E3.L 2T can deliver up to 40W and 70W respectively and would be another pair of candidates.Samsung also mentions a 32TB SSD in the press statement but currently doesn\u2019t produce any such products.That particular model had 512 16Gb chips stacked in 16 layers to form a 1TB package and 32 such packages assembled to deliver the sticker storage capacity of 32TB in a tight 2.5-inch form factor.The 8th generation V-NAND is exactly 8x the size of the 4th generation V-NAND (128Gb vs 16Gb) and assuming that Samsung can replicate its feat from seven years ago, 2.5-inch form factor seems to be the perfect size.There\u2019s one more reason that convinces me that this is what Samsung will use.Samsung recently issued a press release as part of its Flash Memory Summit 2023 appearance containing some scant details of a 256TB SSD that the Korean Chaebol is working on - so here\u2019s what we know.Yong Ho Song, Corporate EVP of Memory Solution Product & Development at Samsung, announced, \"the latest breakthrough of a 256TB SSD with an unprecedented level of integration density\u201d.A rather confusing statement that we\u2019re still trying to decipher.A QLC enterprise SSD would be a first for Samsung but not for the rest of the market.This is likely the part that\u2019s being used; 256TB means that at least 500 1Tb (128GB) chips will be crammed into that SSD.",

eSIM users for data roaming, meaning you can surf the internet in foreign countries for the same price.It allows you to make calls, send messages, and access the internet seamlessly.You don't have to buy a new physical SIM card whenever you visit a new country.If not, another person that gets their hands on the phone can access the sensitive data.The customer ID and details about network connections are embedded into the main processor, so it\u2019s more difficult for anyone to tamper with the SIM to get unauthorized access to sensitive information.It works primarily with software, so the carrier only needs to reconfigure the eSIM (with your permission) so that you can connect to its mobile network.This allows the owner to have two separate numbers on one smartphone, e.g., one for

takes more time and effort.It also has disadvantages, which we\u2019ll also touch on.To switch to an eSIM, you\u2019ll have no choice but to buy a relatively expensive smartphone.2.However, you may still face extra fees for calls and SMS messages.Do eSIMs cost more than physical SIM cards?Non-American versions come with a slot for both eSIM and physical SIM cards because most people across the globe are still used to physical SIM cards.You may be prompted to enter an activation code, so do that and activate your eSIM.Alternatively, you can use a mobile carrier app.It\u2019s a matter of time
