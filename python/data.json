            "paraphrased_content": "You get nine guesses, rather than the six for Wordle, but the rules are otherwise very similar.So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green.The website also includes a practice mode - which I definitely recommend using before attempting the game proper!You also get Quordle Achievements - specific badges for winning a game in a certain number of turns, playing lots of times, or guessing particularly hard words.And rather than complete them in turn, you do so simultaneously.That's the case in Wordle too, of course, but it's even more important in Quordle.You have nine guesses to find the Quordle answers.7.Oh, and it's difficult.Really difficult.What are the Quordle rules?The rules of Quordle are almost identical to those of Wordle.1.3. Letters that are not in the answer turn gray\u2026\n4.It's risky, but will sometimes work.You can't guess ABCDE, for instance.Each guess must be a valid word in Quordle's dictionary.None of Q, Z, X or J appear among today's Quordle answers.Quordle today (game #557) - hint #6 - starting letters (1)Do any of today's Quordle puzzles start with the same letter?\u2022 The number of today's Quordle answers starting with the same letter is 0.If you just want to know the answers at this stage, simply scroll down.Quordle today (game #557) - hint #1 - VowelsHow many different vowels are in Quordle today?\u2022 The number of different vowels in Quordle today is 4*.Plus, it's the only option in Hard mode.There are plenty of other options - you might want to get an M, B, F or G in there instead of the H, maybe - but something like that should do the trick.The first of these should probably be one of the best Wordle starting words, because the same things that make them work well will apply here too.It's time for your daily dose of Quordle hints, plus the answers for both the main game and the Daily Sequence spin off.You do not have to include correct letters in subsequent guesses and there is no equivalent of Wordle's Hard mode.8.In the scenario above, CLAMP would be a great guess, as it could point the way to four of the seven words in one go.2.1.Read on for my Quordle hints to game #557 and the answers to the main game and Daily Sequence.9.Quordle is the only one of the many Wordle clones that I'm still playing now, around 18 months after the daily-word-game craze hit the internet, and with good reason: it's good fun, but also difficult.What's more, its makers (now the online dictionary Merriam-Webster) are also keeping it fresh in the form of a new variant called the Daily Sequence, which sees you complete four puzzles consecutively, rather than concurrently.* Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too).Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green.- and there are daily stats including a streak count.5.Between them, these three words use 15 of the 26 letters in the alphabet including all five vowels, Y, and nine of the most common consonants (S, T, R, D, L, P, N, C and H).\u2026BUT the word you guess appears in all quadrants of the puzzle at the same time, so an A could turn green in one square, yellow in another and gray in the final two.In Wordle, you can instead try several of those in succession and hope one is right, assuming you have enough guesses left.It's played online via the Quordle website and you can also get to it via the Merriam-Webster site, after the dictionary purchased Quordle last year.SPOILER WARNING: Information about Quordle today is below, so don't read on if you don't want to know the answers.Your Quordle expertYour Quordle expertMarc McLarenSocial Links NavigationUK Editor in ChiefMarc is TechRadar\u2019s UK Editor in Chief and has been playing Wordle and Quordle for more than a year.Yes, he takes it all too seriously.And also as with Wordle, the puzzle resets at midnight so you have a fresh challenge each day.Answers are never plural.But in Quordle, this will almost certainly result in a failure - you simply don't have enough guesses.You must complete the daily Quordle before midnight in your timezone.What is a good Quordle strategy?Quordle needs to be approached in a different way to Wordle.There are two key things to remember.Send me an email and let me know.Daily Sequence today (game #557) -

            "paraphrased_content": "The company also suffered an attack affecting over 30,000 organizations due to flaws in its Microsoft Exchange Server software.In a post on LinkedIn, Amit Yoran, the CEO of the cybersecurity company Tenable, says Microsoft\u2019s cybersecurity track record is \u201ceven worse than you think\u201d \u2014 and he has an example to back it up.The US government will soon force companies to become more forthcoming about security issues, as new rules at the Securities and Exchange Commission will require companies to disclose a hack within four days of its discovery.We follow an extensive process involving a thorough investigation, update development for all versions of affected products, and compatibility testing among other operating systems and applications.Ultimately, developing a security update is a delicate balance between timeliness and quality, while ensuring maximized customer protection with minimized customer disruption.Yoran says Microsoft plans to fix the issue by the end of September but calls the delayed response \u201cgrossly irresponsible, if not blatantly negligent.\u201d He also points to data from Google\u2019s Project Zero, which indicates that Microsoft products have made up 42.5 percent of all discovered zero-day vulnerabilities since 2014.Microsoft senior director Jeff Jones responded to Yoran\u2019s criticism in an emailed statement to The Verge:\n\nWe appreciate the collaboration with the security community to responsibly disclose product issues.Tenable initially discovered the flaw in March and found that it could give bad actors access to a company\u2019s sensitive data, including a bank.Yoran claims Microsoft took \u201cmore than 90 days to implement a partial fix\u201d after Tenable notified the company, adding that the fix only applies to \u201cnew applications loaded in the service.\u201d According to Yoran, the bank and all the other organizations \u201cthat had launched the service prior to the fix\u201d are still affected by the flaw \u2014 and are likely unaware of that risk.The attack affected around 25 different organizations and resulted in the theft of sensitive emails from US government officials.Microsoft has been involved in numerous recent data breaches, including the infamous Solar Winds hack that affected agencies across the US government.Last week, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) sent a letter to the US Department of Justice, asking it hold Microsoft accountable for \u201cnegligent cybersecurity practices.\u201d\n\n\n\nYoran has more to add to the senator\u2019s arguments, writing in his post that Microsoft has demonstrated a \u201crepeated pattern of negligent cybersecurity practices,\u201d enabling Chinese hackers to spy on the US government.\u201cWhat you hear from Microsoft is \u2018just trust us,\u2019 but what you get back is very little transparency and a culture of toxic obfuscation,\u201d Yoran writes.He also revealed Tenable\u2019s discovery of an additional cybersecurity flaw in Microsoft Azure and says the company took too long to address it.Microsoft is facing mounting criticism in the wake of last month\u2019s attack on Azure.\u201cHow can a CISO, board of directors or executive team believe that Microsoft will do the right thing given the fact patterns and current behaviors?\u201d\n\nThe security firm Wiz reported last week that the hack on Azure may have been more far-reaching than originally thought, although Microsoft has since disputed its findings.On July 12th, Microsoft disclosed a major breach targeting its Azure platform, which it traced to a Chinese hacking group known as Storm-0558.",

            "paraphrased_content": "However, with the game now live, Larian recommends that you delete any early access saves to guard against possible save corruption calamity.But thanks to the limited time I did get with Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, I can offer some tips, tricks, and thoughts that will get you through the first 20 hours or so of the game.While I haven\u2019t experienced any serious performance issues, it\u2019s obvious from the constant sound of my desktop fans whirring that BG3 is a very resource-intensive game.Image: Larian Studios\n\nSave early, safe often, and prepare to die\n\nI think my biggest complaint about BG3 is how sparingly the game autosaves.So make sure you\u2019ve got a rig capable of running it beyond the minimum requirements.Lmao.After my party missed three out of four of their surprise round attacks, one goblin managed to climb to a higher elevation, chucked something at my grouped-up party, hit an explosive barrel I could not see, and outright killed us all.Taking this approach in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 will get you killed.If all of this looks overwhelming, it is, but the game will sort it out.I\u2019d save right after doing something cool like this.My computer\u2019s only about three years old, running an Intel i5-10400 with 16 gigs of RAM and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660.No word yet on if early access mods are compatible with the live game.Image: Larian Studios\n\nDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff... or the big stuff, for that matter\n\nIf you don\u2019t have experience with D&D or Baldur\u2019s Gate (and, hell, even if you do), BG3 can be intimidating as hell.Being honest, I cannot accurately describe half of what my party is supposed to do.The PS5 launch is on September 6th; the Xbox launch is... well... considerably later after that.Even if you\u2019re not in combat situations, frequent saving is your friend because it is very easy to say or do the wrong thing in front of the wrong NPC, and suddenly a bear is chewing on Astarion.(Or at least it should, but there will inevitably be some places that mainline the game in service of an uncaring SEO machine.)), and my last autosave was some 10 minutes previous.Image: Larian Studios\n\nMake sure you meet the recommended specifications\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 is a chonky-ass game, taking up around 120 gigs of space.\u201cWe\u2019ve taken measures to ensure a smooth transition into the launch version of BG3, but we still recommend deleting your in-game Early Access save files if you still have access to an Early Access version of the game,\u201d read a blog on BG3\u2019s Steam page.Or simply wait until the game comes out on consoles.This, combined with how relatively easy it is for your party to just straight-up die, makes for an incredibly frustrating early game experience.There\u2019s a lot more discussion to be had about Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, but this is a good starting point for those starting out.Save often \u2014\u00a0you can even do it mid-combat!This should be light work.\u201d\n\nLol.After six years in development and three years in early access, Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 is now live everywhere in the world.I\u2019ve found that building my party around combat hasn\u2019t hampered my ability to role-play successfully.And since I figured potions already do a decent enough healing job, I shouldn\u2019t waste a party slot on her.Though I\u2019ve never played a rogue, BG3 taught me pretty effectively that to get the most out of Astarion, his targets should either never see him or be distracted by another party member.Good luck, have fun, and for the love of Tyr, don\u2019t forget to save your game often.Frequent saving is your friend\n\nI went from fine to FUBAR in the space of one (un)lucky dice roll.Often.In one of my early adventures, after just mopping up a band of goblins, I stumbled upon three very low-level goblins enjoying some day drinking.I just know that Gale, Wyll, and my sorcerer do the pew pew, Lae\u2019zel and Astarion do the stabitty stab, and Shadowheart does the heal-y heals.Larian also recommends deleting any mods and uninstalling the early access version of the game and reinstalling it now that it\u2019s live.Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 is basically Dungeons and Dragons: The Video Game, and players should not approach combat as one typically would a non-D&D-based game.Despite this, I\u2019m still pretty effective at murder-hoboing my way through Faer\u00fbn because the game does a good job of laying out my party\u2019s abilities and the conditions needed to make them effective in the moment I need them.Many games use their early encounters to onboard the player, letting you go from fight to fight to fight, mowing down enemies with nary more than a scratch.The game is also decently flexible.Your sanity and your downed party members will thank you.Pick what sounds cool, and the game will teach you the rest.Shadowheart didn\u2019t seem to have a lot going beyond her healing spells.So when you\u2019re reading all the class, subclass, feats, traits, or spell descriptions and start to feel your eyes glaze over, don\u2019t worry about it.But because the game showed me that her Guidance ability can be cast anytime I need to talk my way into or out of a situation, she immediately became an indispensable party member.There are so many races and classes and subclasses with domains and archetypes and spells to choose from that it can get overwhelming.Though my party wasn\u2019t at full health, I thought, \u201cIt\u2019s only three of them, four of us, and I surprised them.And, better yet, Baldur\u2019s Gate doesn\u2019t do the whole \u201crestart at the beginning of an encounter\u201d thing (WHICH IT SHOULD!Due to the sheer size of the game, with reports boasting 174 hours worth of cutscenes and over 17,000 ending variations, and an impossible review window \u2014 The Verge received our code on Sunday \u2014 it\u2019s going to take a while before formal reviews start popping up.Make sure you\u2019ve got a rig capable of running it beyond the minimum requirements\n\nSay goodbye to those early access saves\n\nBG3 has been in early access for three years, which, according to a Bloomberg profile of the game\u2019s development, was a successful way for fans to experience bits of the game while giving developer Larian Studios more time and money to finish this gargantuan endeavor.With these specifications, I\u2019m solidly between the minimum and what Larian recommends, and it is evident.",

            "paraphrased_content": "\u201cWe hope to have an update by the end of the year.\u201d\nBaldur\u2019s Gate III is a highly anticipated role-playing game set in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, offering familiar classes and abilities in an expansive high-fantasy world.\u201cWe have no exclusivity deal that prevents us from launching on Xbox,\u201d Larian Studios director of publishing Michael Douse said on X in July.Xbox said at a Brazilian game festival in June that it has over 21 million players on Xbox Series X and Series S consoles.\u201cStudios have been through one development cycle where Series S turned out to be an albatross around the neck of production, and now that games are firmly being developed with new consoles in mind, teams do not want to repeat the process.\u201d\nRocksteady senior character technical artist Lee Devonald similarly tweeted about his experience building Gotham Knights \u2014 a game that shipped on consoles with a framerate locked at 30 fps and no performance mode.The debate over this potentiality hit a fever pitch last year, with players asking whether the Series S was \u201cholding back\u201d the ninth console generation overall.We cannot remove the split-screen feature because we are obliged to launch with feature parity, and so continue to try and make it work.\u201d\nLarian Studios\nLarian is having trouble fitting Baldur\u2019s Gate III on the Xbox Series S, the lower-priced and lower-powered console in Microsoft\u2019s ninth-generation lineup.The series spawned spin-offs and enhanced editions, but Baldur\u2019s Gate III is the franchise\u2019s first mainline installment in more than 20 years.While both the Xbox Series X and PS5 have 16GB RAM, the Series S has just 10GB, running at a slower speed than the other consoles, which dramatically lowers its total memory bandwidth.To be clear, the game itself is complete, but its rollout is fragmented, with different release dates for each of its planned platforms.(The Series S\u2019 GPU is also significantly underpowered compared with the PS5 and Series X, but it\u2019s much easier to \u201cturn down the graphics\u201d than to recode your game.)Reviews for the PC version are already rolling in, and they\u2019re looking good overall.The game\u2019s developer, Larian Studios, hasn\u2019t provided a release date for the Xbox Series X and S edition.Larian Studios\nWith the Xbox Series X/S, Microsoft pivoted away from the traditional console-upgrade cycle and instead focused on establishing its wider gaming ecosystem, which centers cloud play in a post-hardware future.\u201cMANY developers have been sitting in meetings for the past year desperately trying to get Series S launch requirements dropped,\u201d Bossa Studios VFX artist Ian Maclure tweeted at the time.This isn\u2019t a wholly unprecedented situation.Though Microsoft\u2019s parity requirements have been in place since the Xbox Series consoles came to market in November 2020, Baldur\u2019s Gate III is the ecosystem\u2019s highest-profile loss directly attributable to these restrictions.In the case of Baludr\u2019s Gate III, though, something went wrong \u2014 specifically with the Xbox version.The original Baldur\u2019s Gate landed in 1998 to critical and commercial acclaim, and Baldur\u2019s Gate II: Shadows of Amn followed in 2000.This has largely worked out for Sony: It\u2019s leading in console sales, with more than 40 million PS5s in homes around the globe.Following a lengthy Early Access period, the PC and Mac version of Baldur\u2019s Gate III went live today, August 3, while the PlayStation 5 version is due out on September 6.\u201cThe issue is a technical hurdle.\u201cWe have quite a few engineers working very hard to do what no other RPG of this scale has achieved: seamless drop-in, drop-out co-op on Series S,\u201d Douse said on X.Clearly, there is potential for Microsoft\u2019s parity requirement to limit the availability, scope and quality of games on the Xbox Series X.Sony, meanwhile, stuck to tradition \u2014 its pitch for the PS5 is more power, faster loading, better graphics and smoother animations than the PS4.PS5 players will get to try out the console version on September 6, but Xbox Series X/S players will have to wait.After all, plenty of games come out at different times on various platforms, determined by licensing and exclusivity deals, or simply developer priority.Larian Studios\nLarian's issue is likely to be related to RAM.Regardless of whether the Series S is restraining the entire video game industry, Xbox parity requirements are literally holding back Baldur\u2019s Gate III, and this system has accidentally created another console exclusive for the PS5, for now.According to Gamerant, Devonald said that multiplatform developers had to \u201coptimize for the lowest performer,\u201d and, \u201cwe have a current-gen console that\u2019s not much better than a last gen one,\u201d referencing the Xbox Series S.\n\"[An] entire generation of games, hamstrung by that potato,\" Devonald tweeted.There weren\u2019t a ton of concrete examples to prove this theory, and the Digital Foundry team argued against the idea, citing the existing variance in the PC market and saying that lower targets could actually help games run even better on higher-powered consoles.Still, a handful of developers from the indie and AAA space went public in late 2022 with their frustrations around the parity rule.Baldur\u2019s Gate III is available right now \u2014 partially.Microsoft requires all games to run, feature-complete and without changes in quality or mechanics, on both the Xbox Series X and Series S. With Baldur\u2019s Gate III, this parity rule means the game will be console-exclusive to the PS5 for four months, at least.",

            "paraphrased_content": "\u201cActivityPub is another instantiation of the basic idea of the internet \u2026 every node should be able to talk with any other node at the simplest level,\u201d says Sorin Matei, communications professor and associate dean at Purdue University.\u201cThe most important thing is the first principles built around both these protocols are identical,\u201d McCue told Engadget.\u201cThe biggest hurdle to users switching platforms when those platforms become exploitative is the lock-in of the social graph, the fact that switching platforms means abandoning everyone you know and who knows you.The ActivityPub protocol was officially established in 2018, but the idea of federated platforms is even older.But Meta\u2019s entry into the space could expose a lot more people to the power, and perils, of decentralized social networks.The concept is often compared to email, which also relies on foundational protocols that most people don\u2019t think much about.Schulman notes that Meta may have more self-serving motivations.\u201cIt reminds me of the early, heady days of the Internet, when the web was happening,\u201d Mike McCue, a former Netscape executive and current CEO of Flipboard said.It\u2019s still unclear how long it will take Meta to actually add ActivitySupport for Threads.That\u2019s not starting to change as larger and more mainstream platforms begin to experiment with ActivityPub.Bluesky, which does currently have centralized moderation, has also dealt with some controversies surrounding its handling of trust and safety.In addition to technical complications involved, there are also serious moderation issues associated with the fediverse, where communities are responsible for setting their own rules and norms.\u201cThey're trying to portray themselves as not anti-competitive,\u201d Schulman said, pointing to recent regulatory scrutiny.For now, the most prominent clue is the \u201cthreads.net\u201d URL at the top of each user\u2019s profile.While the jury is still out on whether Meta\u2019s new Threads will be a Twitter killer, the app could still upend how we think of social networks.What even is decentralized social media?For close watchers of the fediverse \u2014 the collection of decentralized services that run on ActivityPub \u2014 those 15 words could be the start of one of the most consequential moments for the technology.The fact that large platforms are adopting ActivityPub is not only validation of the movement towards decentralized social media, but a path forward for people locked into these platforms to switch to better providers.Instagram\u2019s top exec has cautioned it will take time.\u201cI can email somebody with a random .com address from my .edu address and it just works, the servers talk to each other and the email is delivered,\u201d explains Ross Schulman, the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s decentralization fellow.The service, which began as an offshoot of Twitter but severed all ties with the company last year, has racked up hundreds of thousands of users in its closed beta.Which in turn, puts pressure on such platforms to provide better, less exploitative services.This is a clear victory for our cause, hopefully one of many to come.\u201d\u201cInstead of exchanging little short messages that we call emails, they exchange little short messages that we call social media, or images or likes, or replies.\u201d\nRight now, this kind of experience is limited to Mastodon and other, more niche services that make up the current fediverse.New users began to flood Mastodon in the days immediately after his bid was announced, and there have been regular surges that coincide with controversial decisions he\u2019s made since.News aggregator Flipboard is even more invested.The company has started its own Mastodon instance, promised to adopt ActivityPub and added integrations with Bluesky, another decentralized platform that uses its own protocol.Researchers have recently flagged the prevalence of CSAM on some servers.The service currently has just over 2 million active users, according to founder Eugen Rochko.Blogging platform Medium started its own Mastodon instance last year, and now offers membership as a premium \"perk\" to paying subscribers.Yet the company has talked glowingly about the promise of the fediverse.The acquisition represented a \u201ctectonic shift\u201d for decentralized social media, Matei tells Engadget.Meta will need to ensure that Threads, which has the same content policies as Instagram, is interoperable with the fediverse while keeping out content that doesn\u2019t align with its rules.Already, there are projects to \u201cbridge\u201d the two, and some fediverse enthusiasts suspect the distinction between the two will matter less as both Mastodon and Bluesky mature.Decentralized social media promises a similar experience, he says.\u201cThey think it will actually create a better experience for their users,\u201d Schulman told Engadget.While Zuckerberg has championed \u201cinteroperability\u201d in the past, Meta hasn\u2019t historically been welcoming to potential competing networks.Unlike Mastodon, the team behind Bluesky is developing its own federated protocol, the AT Protocol.\u201cThe most important thing is there's an open protocol \u2014 actually two \u2014 to build the federated social web.\u201d\nFor now, the number of people using the federated social web, though, is still small compared with more established platforms.Some Mastodon servers have pledged to block Threads in order to wall off their users from the Facebook owner.Despite the recent surge in interest, the idea of the fediverse and decentralized, protocol-based social media is far from new.While interest in the fediverse has been growing over the last year, it\u2019s still not widely understood, even by some who are active on places like Mastodon.Yet smaller and mid-size companies are investing in the protocols and the platforms they power because they see the surging interest as an opportunity to bolster their own communities.Though Mastodon gained some notoriety in 2017, much of the fediverse remained relatively obscure \u2014 until Elon Musk announced his plan to take over Twitter.\u201cWhether that\u2019s the promise of an even larger reader pool or access to more people to follow.\u201d\nMeta, which already operates some of the most dominant social networks, may have different motivations.\u201cOur vision is that people using compatible apps will be able to follow and interact with people on Threads without having a Threads account, and vice versa, ushering in a new era of diverse and interconnected networks,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post announcing Threads.Tumblr has said it plans to support ActivityPub.\u201cSoon, you\u2019ll be able to follow and interact with people on other fediverse platforms, like Mastodon,\u201d it reads.Mozilla has also started its own Mastodon instance, calling it a \u201clong-term investment\u201d in the future of social media.But he made clear he was broadly supportive of Meta\u2019s efforts.Why now?\u201cI believe that this is where the entire social media space will go.\u201d\nBecause they are open source and not controlled by a single entity, ActivityPub and other protocols allow users to interact with each other\u2019s content, regardless of where it originated.The BBC recently announced the start of a six-month experiment with Mastodon.For enthusiasts, the rise of decentralized platforms represents an opportunity for a more open web \u2014 a chance to tear down some of the walled gardens that have become the norm on mainstream social media platforms.\u201cWe have been advocating for interoperability between platforms for years,\u201d he wrote shortly.Though that functionality hasn\u2019t been built yet, there are hints about it sprinkled throughout the service.For now, the only instance of Bluesky is the closed beta, but the company has said it plans to start testing federation.It currently links to a brief message that hints at what\u2019s coming.Bluesky, another decentralized platform, has also notched early success.Not because of how many users it has, but because of Meta\u2019s promise to integrate ActivityPub, the decentralized protocol that powers Mastodon and other fediverse apps, into Threads.The stricter approach may also explain why some fediverse backers were not excited about the prospect of Meta joining their ranks, even tangentially.And while the AT Protocol and ActivityPub are separate standards, the visions behind them are similar.Mastodon\u2019s Rochko alluded to the discontent in a blog post after Threads\u2019 launch, assuring users that Meta won\u2019t be able to serve ads or access the data of Mastodon users.",

            "paraphrased_content": "I\u2019ve asked the r/gifs moderators about why there have been so few posts as of late.More than 1,800 subreddits are still private in protest, according to the Reddark tracker.But sometime recently, r/pics removed any obvious trace of its connections to John Oliver; the Wayback Machine shows that r/pics was all about John Oliver as of Friday but no longer on Saturday.\u201cAfter an initial spike to normal levels when the subreddit reopened, overall\u00a0subreddit traffic\u00a0fell to between half and a third of normal, though the influx of subscribers paradoxically grew more than the number of people unsubscribing,\u201d the mod wrote.r/pics (with more than 30 million subscribers) had perhaps been the most visibly tied to John Oliver: Oliver himself posted a series of silly photos specifically for the community to use, and at one point, the moderators of r/pics invited Oliver to join the mod team.In June, more than 8,000 communities went dark to protest the API pricing, but in the weeks since, many subreddits have opened back up (some after feeling pressure from Reddit) and are operating as they did before.\u201cFor those who think our protest went on too long, you may want to remind yourselves\u00a0why we did this in the first place,\u201d a mod wrote in a post about the decision.However, they added that \u201cit\u2019s unlikely that it had any significant effect on sitewide traffic, as other subreddits just filled the gaps in the endless feed of content most users consume.\u201d\n\nTwo other big communities have switched back, too.However, the newest post I can find on the subreddit is from nine days ago, and strangely, the second-newest post is from a month ago.Earlier this month, the r/videos moderators reverted the rules to what they were before the protests started.One of the subreddits, r/aww (which has more than 34 million subscribers), posted a long explanation for the change.The subreddits had made the switch in June to push back on Reddit\u2019s API pricing that ultimately made some popular third-party apps shut down, but now, they\u2019re operating pretty much as they did before the protests.I haven\u2019t found an explanation from the moderation team about the change, and the team hasn\u2019t replied to my Reddit DM asking for comment.r/videos (with more than 26 million subscribers) actually dropped its John Oliver rule back in June; it was replaced by a new rule that all posts needed to contain profanity in the title after a community vote.While the r/aww community did vote \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d for the John Oliver rule, \u201cit was never intended to be permanent,\u201d a moderator wrote in the post, which was published earlier this week.Many users are still disgruntled, though, and made their feelings known in July\u2019s r/Place canvas.\u201cReddit still has some issues to address.\u201d\n\nRelatedHow Reddit crushed the biggest protest in its historyReddit is closing r/Place \u2018until we meet again\u2019\n\nr/gifs (with more than 21 million subscribers) remains focused on John Oliver, according to the community\u2019s rules.\u201cMore than a month has passed, and as things on the internet go, the passion for the protest has waned and people\u2019s attention has shifted to other things.\u201d\n\nThe change did reduce traffic\n\nThe mod says that the change did reduce traffic to the subreddit.Three of Reddit\u2019s biggest communities are no longer focused entirely on John Oliver in a form of protest against Reddit.",

            "paraphrased_content": "While D&D itself may be synonymous with playing with friends, I see Baldur's Gate 3 primarily as a fantastic single player cRPG set in that world and that ruleset rather than a one-to-one replica of the tabletop experience.Please do it, Larian.Firstly, as listed in our five beginner tips, quicksave is your best friend in Baldur's Gate 3, even more so if you choose a high difficulty setting.Whereas Valve fans are still waiting for Half-Life 3 and SEGA fans ultimately got Shenmue III as a decent but not quite great game, after 17 hours of hands-on with the final build of Baldur's Gate 3, I'm positive that Larian is poised to deliver on the enormous hype.It's easy to be absorbed in the wonderful rendition of Faer\u00fbn crafted by Larian and forget to hit that save button, but that will only lead you into complex situations that can easily get out of hand.I fully agree with Francesco's review-in-progress assessment that if this game can maintain the level of quality seen in the first Act for all of its massive scope, it could easily get the throne of best cRPG ever.I\u2019m super proud of what our team accomplished, and I hope you will have an incredible amount of fun exploring what we prepared for you.While there were a few spin-offs, the third installment in the mainline series remained but a dream for over twenty years, much like similarly beloved franchises like Shenmue or Half-Life.No multiplayer game can absorb you in a storyline as well as a single player one, and Baldur's Gate 3 is definitely a game where you want to soak in every line of dialogue on your own time and without any external interferences for maximum enjoyment.Share this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n TwitterFor over six years, more than 400 of us poured our hearts and souls into making this, helped by over 2.5 million Early Access players who spent countless hours giving us feedback.Even the most well-meaning friends will never be able to take the reins of a character like Karlach or Gale and play them as the creators of this game wrote them.I don't want someone's version of Karlach, I want Karlach as Larian intended her to be, and I can only have that when playing solo.The result is a beautiful, rich universe where you can escape from your daily worries, experience adventure and wonder, and have many many cool and exciting encounters.Swen Vincke: It\u2019s hard to express how much love went into creating Baldur\u2019s Gate 3.Secondly, as mentioned in the headline, it is my firm belief that you should not play this game in co-op, at least not for your first playthrough.If that wasn't enough to convince you, there's still the harsh truth that no game's story can survive contact with a group of players all doing their own thing, laughing, asking how to do this and that, not to mention potentially putting music on or talking to someone in real while they're on Discord with you.Related StoryFrancesco De MeoBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 Review in Progress \u2013 Rolling a Natural 20I'm here to share with you a couple of things straight from my experience, though.Yes, the game supports multiplayer from the get-go, but Baldur's Gate 3 shines brightest in the reactivity of the game world and your companion NPCs, not to mention the wonderful storylines, all of which are inevitably dampened if you don't play solo.Remember that you can do so at any time, even during combat or in the middle of a dialogue, so just do it and reject any misguided feeling of guilt.Even writing these words feels a bit surreal for someone who played the sacred original titles when they came out.On another note, Larian celebrated the long-awaited release with an awesome Baldur's Gate 3 launch trailer and a few words from CEO Swen Vincke.All that said, you're free to do as you please, and there's certainly merit to the idea of playing this game in co-op - but only as a second or perhaps even third playthrough, once you are intimately familiar with the story beats and the characters as they were designed.You can find both below.Furthermore, if the developers were ever to add a Game Master mode similar to the one they made for Divinity: Original Sin 2, then the prospect of playing D&D in Baldur's Gate 3 would suddenly become extremely enticing.It could even be a paid DLC, and it'd probably sell gangbusters anyway.Let's put aside any intentional mayhem that another player could inflict on you in the midst of a session.It\u2019s a place where your identity and choices matter, where surprise lies around every corner, and where your agency is truly rewarded.They were a revelation at the time and opened the heart's way to a lifelong passion for the Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game and the Faer\u00fbn setting.Baldur's Gate 3 is out now on PC via Steam and GOG.You'll only be able to avoid an unwanted outcome if you save as much as possible, ideally every five minutes or so.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Given its price, I expect its build to stand up to a good deal of use, and so far, I have no complaints in this regard.Luckily, an instruction manual and a shorter-length operation guide are on hand to enlighten you.After 22 seconds, hitting the perfect nine bars, I had about 30ml of espresso at a temperature of 135\u00b0F.Be sure to never get the grinder wet; Casabrews puts a stunning amount of warnings about this.You can also pick it up from third-party retailers such as Amazon and Home Depot, but the best deals are on the Casabrews website.There\u2019s no doubt that with a list price of $899.99, the 5700Pro espresso machine is expensive.While I never had an issue with the filter falling out as I did this, the process did sometimes get a little messy.I\u2019ve yet to figure out how to do this, however.Adjusting the grind size is easy enough, with Casabrews recommending you start at setting 8, turning the grinder up or down to make it coarser or finer, depending on the bar pressure and brew results.Next, it\u2019s recommended that you use the distributor, to spread the grounds evenly in the portafilter.It took one hand to hold onto the machine while the other locked the filter into position.In reality, though, achieving your perfect shot of espresso involves a lot of trial and error, especially when it comes to finding the best grind size for your brews.However, do keep in mind that if you haven\u2019t used an espresso machine before, there\u2019s a bit of a learning curve.Size-wise, it\u2019s on par with other espresso machines offering similar functionality, at 12.8 x 11.2 x 16.5 inches with the bean hopper on top.Note that the 5700Pro will also evenly distribute the espresso into two separate vessels, if you want to make separate drinks.(Image credit: Future)The Casabrews 5700Pro comes with both a steam wand that was a joy to use and an easy-to-turn dial on the side of the machine.Speaking of the LCD panel, the Casabrews 5700Pro\u2019s generously sized screen displays such information as grind time for filling the portafilter, time of extraction, pressure, and more.The water runs out with a good deal of pressure, annihilating any of the crema on the espresso \u2013 which I found disappointing, since an americano is my go-to everyday drink.There\u2019s also a distributor, which helps spread the coffee grounds evenly, \u00a0and a tamper to apply pressure, while a small rubber mat is included to support the portafilter as you perform these tasks.You can access both using the same process as changing the water temperature.I never found this to be an inconvenience, though.The knob is more straightforward to use; you simply turn to choose the available settings \u2013 steam ready, steam, off, or hot water.Experts and novices alike will appreciate its capabilities.Likewise, with the steam wand.The grinder offers 15 different grind sizes, and you can select the time for which the grinder distributes grinds into the portafilter for a more hands-off experience.You\u2019ll also find other budget-friendly alternatives in the Casabrews range, which drop features such as the built-in grinder or the LCD panel, for example, to come in at a more competitive price.A separate spout that didn\u2019t push water out so fast, such as that included in the Breville Barista Express Impress would have been better.The plastic water reservoir slots into the back of the machine, which makes it slightly challenging to get to when it needs to be filled; Casabrews recommends filling it with \u201cfresh, cold tap water before each use.\u201d I\u2019m lazy, adding water only when the level went below the minimum fill line on most days.Be aware that this machine gets quite noisy, hitting 65dB in use.Read our Seattle Coffee Gear Diletta Bello review to learn moreHow I tested the Casabrews 5700ProTested for three weeksUsed all settings on the machineI tested the machine for three weeks, with several different varieties of coffee beans to compare performance.There are a few other settings you can play around with on the Casabrews, although I didn\u2019t find them particularly helpful.(Image credit: Future)As mentioned, this machine comes with a grinder preinstalled.The machine itself is quite heavy, weighing a whisker over 20 lbs, so it\u2019s not something you\u2019ll want to be moving around a lot.For example, you can make the espresso shot with warmer or colder water, but not set an actual temperature.I wish there was a better solution.Casabrews was founded in 2020 and deals exclusively in coffee machines, making sleek yet functional options for a variety of budgets.I used both the single and double filters on the portafilter, and I made several cappuccinos and lattes, testing the abilities of the steam wand.The wand moves fairly easily while still feeling securely attached to the main body of the machine.The espresso brewed with these settings resulted in a shot with a nice, bold flavor, a tiny hint of acidity and some sweetness \u2013 something that I welcome.The Casabrews 5700Pro took the place of my usual Breville Barista Express.I heated 2% milk until it was too hot to touch the jug, about 52 seconds.Performance score: 4.5/5(Image credit: Future)Should I buy the Casabrews 5700Pro?Swipe to scroll horizontallyGaggia Accademia report cardAttributesNotesRatingValueOffers great performance and features at the sale price.4/5Design A sleek, durable build with a stainless steel finish, a built-in grinder, a steam wand, but a slightly confusing control panel.4.5/5PerformanceMakes full-bodied espresso with  a  thick, golden crema.Note, however, that the whole brewing process can be noisy, and I\u2019ve experienced issues with vibrations moving my espresso cup \u2013 so be prepared.There is a cleaning brush to help with the process, and the manual provides very clear instructions for all the cleaning processes.Only this time, I had 60ml of espresso to sip on or use in specialty drinks.My first few espressos were above that, and while they still tasted rich and bold, the crema was lacking.With my beans of choice, I settled on a sweet spot of a grind size of 6.5 and an 11-second timer for the grinder using the single shot filter.I added a teaspoon of sugar to the top of the crema to see how it held up; it rested on top for a few seconds before dropping to the bottom \u2013 all signs of good espresso.It took about 1 minute for the machine to preheat, time I used to ground the beans.It\u2019s recommended you flush the machine through every week, which simply involves a water clean that takes one minute and minimal effort on your part.Most of the machine is already put together, including the grinder \u2013 a spare is provided, in case you damage the original.To get frothing, simply move the dial to the steam-ready notch until the indicator light is steady, which takes about 20 seconds.I kept most of the settings as is, other than adjusting the grind time for filling the portafilter.This process is loud, hitting 75-80dB with the pump thumping every couple of seconds.That said, I\u2019ve yet to see the Casabrews 5700Pro selling at its list price, so if you manage to pick it up for $500 or less, it\u2019s a great deal.The 5700Pro is the top-of-the-line model in Casabrews\u2019 range, so if you\u2019re looking to spend less then there are several alternatives available.This isn\u2019t a tool I\u2019ve seen included with other espresso machines I\u2019ve used, but it works surprisingly well.Also included are a milk jug for steaming, a coffee spoon, cleaning utensils, and a decorating pen \u2013 all of which I\u2019ve rarely used, if at all.It takes some strength to slot the portafilter into the brew head, but once done, it\u2019s ready to brew.There doesn\u2019t appear to be any type of filter at the bottom of the tank, which is disappointing.As far as maintenance goes, The Casabrews 5700Pro is on a par with similar espresso machines.I flushed the machine many more times than the one time recommended, however, since the water had a strange fishy smell.The steam wand heats milk fast with a great foam consistency, but the machine is noisy in use.Read our Breville Barista Express Impress review to learn moreSeattle Coffee Gear Diletta Bello\nIf you're intimidated by a manual drive, this one might not be for you, but it's an incredibly impressive device that almost matches professional-grade coffee machines.I didn\u2019t notice any difference between \u201cfresh\u201d versus \u201cdays old\u201d water, but it could play into the longevity of the machine.Overall, if you love espresso or espresso-based drinks, the Casabrews 5700Pro is one of the best espresso machines available, especially when you consider the price and features.With features such as a built-in grinder and steam wand, it has plenty going for it; but models such as Breville\u2019s Barista Express Impress offer the same features for less.Inside, you\u2019ll find a number of accessories, which could prove overwhelming for those who haven\u2019t used an espresso machine before and remain unaware of the purpose of these different components.The final attachments include the steam wand and a knob.As I mentioned, you can save the grind time of the double dose as well, so about 18 seconds procured the ideal amount of grounds for the brew.There was beautiful, thick golden crema on top that reformed when cut with a spoon.It\u2019s relatively easy to use \u2013 and even those new to espresso machines will be able to learn quickly \u2013 although making a shot is a bit more involved than it would be with a pod machine or a basic coffee maker.In addition to making superb espresso, the steam wand heats milk and creates a thick, lasting foam that\u2019s ideal for cappuccinos, lattes, and more.You love fresh ground coffee.For cleaning, the grinder can be removed and replaced easily, with the machine's LCD panel indicating if it isn\u2019t properly in place.However, I do wish that there was a separate water dispenser rather than having to rely on the wand, which delivers water with a bit too much pressure.You can select a grind size of between 1-15, simply by turning the notch.The brand has gained some notoriety on TikTok, and having used the 5700Pro for the past few weeks, I can see why it\u2019s received some social media love \u2013 especially when you consider its low price.The 3700 Gense costs around $150 and comes with a steam wand and pressure gauge, but no built-in grinder, while the 5700 Gense retails for slightly less than the 5700Pro, yet comes with almost all the same features; there\u2019s no LCD screen, though.Value

difficult to navigateThe Casabrews 5700Pro arrives in a large, pretty bulky box.I just wish there was somewhere to store these accessories on the machine so they don\u2019t get lost.Admittedly, I found this screen difficult to master.Design score: 4.5/5(Image credit: Future)Casabrews 5700Pro: performanceProduces flavorful espresso with a thick, golden cremaNoisy, strong vibrations in useSteam wand heats milk fast with long-lasting foamThe Casabrews 5700Pro is fairly easy to use.An instruction sticker on the machine itself, as well as a more in-depth guide of how to make espresso, can be found in the manual that accompanies the machine.It takes up a good deal of space on my counter, and only just fits under my cabinets, making it better for those with more spacious kitchens.If you\u2019re looking for a commercial espresso machine experience, but without having to part with a fortune, the Casabrews 5700Pro is a sleek, compact alternative.The LCD panel displays the brew time and pressure, and if you fail to pull perfect results with your first shot, making adjustments is simple.4.5/5Buy it if...You want excellent-tasting espresso at home.After several run-throughs, the smell dissipated.However, this isn\u2019t unusual with espresso machines in this price category.The only parts you need to attach are the 0.4-gallon bean hopper, the 91oz water reservoir, and the filter holder bracket \u2013\u00a0which proved the trickiest.It proved to be a worthy replacement for that machine.When brewing an espresso, the machine heats up quickly and is ready to pull shots in about one minute.Note that this does take a bit of muscle.I tested Oatly oat milk as well with similar results, though it was slightly less foamy than the 2% milk.It\u2019s important to note that you can\u2019t brew espresso at the same time, and there\u2019s a slight delay before you can brew a fresh shot of espresso after steaming.Descaling is a similar process, but you add a descaling agent to the water \u2013 vinegar is my favorite affordable option.According to the instruction manual, you\u2019re also able to set the volume of the espresso shots, with the single shot being 20-60ml and double from 60-120ml.I used a spoon, or hit the portafilter hard against my garbage can to get the puck out.You\u2019re seeking a simple-to-use espresso machine\u00a0\nUnlike pod espresso machines, the process here is a bit more involved \u2013 and in order to perfect your brew, you\u2019ll likely need to play around with settings.You\u2019re tight on space\nThe 5700Pro is bulkier than more basic coffee makers, and will take up a good deal of space on your countertop.Also consider...Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 Breville Barista Express Impress Seattle Coffee Gear

consider...Breville Barista Express Impress\u00a0\nThis slightly more affordable model is one of our favorites, offering almost all the tools you'll need to create barista-level coffees in your own kitchen.The LCD times the espresso as it brews and lets you know the pressure bars.One-minute reviewThe Casabrews 5700Pro is an espresso machine that features an automatic, built-in grinder and steam wand, so you can use your favorite beans to make coffeehouse-style drinks at home.As for the other accessories you\u2019re likely to use daily, there\u2019s a portafilter offering two filter sizes \u2013 single and double \u2013 that are easy to pop in and out.A steam wand is on hand to heat and foam milk in under 30 seconds, while the same wand can deliver hot water \u2013 with a little too much water pressure, in my opinion \u2013 for americanos or teas.A weighty distributor and tamper are included, too, making the ground coffee ready to brew.And while it is possible to adjust the temperature of the espresso shot and the volume, the process for doing so is a bit convoluted and super confusing.The only other component that may occasionally need maintenance is the grinder, and the Casabrews 5700Pro will alert you when it\u2019s time to do so via the LCD.Five minutes later, the foam was still intact and held its shape following a dusting of cinnamon powder on top, making it perfect for cappuccinos and lattes.Admittedly, the LCD and control panel are slightly confusing to use at first, but most should become familiar following a few uses.Getting the portafilter out of the machine was as difficult as getting it in, and neither does the Casabrew machine come with a tool to easily remove the used grinds.My latte tasted similar, although I preferred the extra foamy cappuccino I created.It\u2019s possible to engage the grinder and stop it automatically by setting the time on the LCD using the Dose dial.You want to make specialty beverage.Just be prepared for some trial and error with the settings to achieve your perfect shot of espresso.Once you\u2019ve applied a bit of pressure to the beans using the solid, metal tamper, you\u2019re good to slot the portafilter into the brew head.It\u2019s simple to take out and put back in.The coffee taste still cut through the milk, making a tasty, warm beverage to enjoy.The time to get these results wasn\u2019t very long.Setting up the Casabrews 5700Pro is more straightforward than it might first appear.Scrolling to the setting took a while, and in testing, it only made the temperature different by 10\u00b0F \u2013 not enough to make a noticeable difference, in my opinion.You get a cup full of hot water each time you turn the knob, or turn it back to \u201coff\u201d to stop the water flow.This machine makes espresso on a par with many coffee shops, delivering a shot with a rich taste and lovely golden crema.It means that calcium buildup as a result of hard water could lead to issues down the road.Nevertheless, it took about 10 minutes to get the machine set up for first use, which included washing and drying many of the parts before assembly.Before the first use, you\u2019re supposed to run through a brew cycle, to flush out the machine.The resulting steamed milk had a temperature of 145\u00b0F \u00a0and a good layer of thick, foamy bubbles on top.Nevertheless, at least the actual espresso results were successful and tasty.While it isn\u2019t possible to brew another shot immediately after, the machine will be good to go again inside a minute or so.There\u2019s also a good deal of vibration; I found the espresso cup I was using started to move around a fair bit, leaving splashes all around the outer rim of the cup.There are two cleaning modes: flush and descale.This is a 20-bar pressure machine, although you\u2019ll never want your espresso to hit that level.There are several well-labeled controls sitting below the panel, such as a dose dial and menu button, plus a Single and Double espresso button.(Image credit: Future)Casabrews 5700Pro review: price and availability\u00a0List price: \u00a0$899.99Only available in the USYou can purchase the Casabrews 5700Pro direct from the Casabrews website; it\u2019s currently on sale for $459.99.The Casabrews 5700Pro\u2019s finish is almost exclusively stainless steel, with its sleek, polished look matching many of the other appliances in my kitchen.But the rich, flavorful results are worth the effort.It takes about 45 seconds to get a cup full of water around 160\u00b0F \u2013 while not an ideal temperature for tea, it will work when you\u2019re in a pinch.The ideal number is around 9.With a built-in bean hopper and grinder that fills your portafilter automatically, you can enjoy your favorite coffee beans with minimal effort.Don\u2019t buy it if...You want a quiet espresso machine\u00a0\nAt times the Casabrews 5700Pro can be noisy, hitting an average 65dB when brewing and 75-80dB when steaming milk.The Casabrews also delivers hot water for making an americano or tea through the steam wand.Then you steam the milk using a metal steam jug and steam wand.It\u2019s easy to clean, too.Otherwise, if you find the filter is getting too full, you can push the portafilter back in to stop grinding.If you\u2019re looking to double the amount of espresso you brew, simply swap out the single filter for the double.The drip tray and plate that slot into the bottom of the machine offer a similarly sturdy feel, and the tray features a tab that will pop up when it needs to be emptied; it holds a good deal of water, requiring me to empty it only once during a week of use.It\u2019s possible to set different timers for the single or double filters, which is extra handy.Having followed the same steps and selecting the \u201cdouble\u201d shot button, it took the machine 27 seconds to pour an espresso with similar attributes to the first.Then it was simply a matter of placing a cup under the machine and pressing the \u201csingle\u201d shot button.When adding the espresso, steamed milk, and foam in a \u2153 ratio, I made cappuccino on par with a good deal of coffee shops I frequent.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Midnight Blizzard (NOBELIUM) has also conducted session replay attacks to gain initial access to cloud resources leveraging stolen sessions likely acquired via illicit sale,\u201d Microsoft explained.Microsoft also said that the campaign affected \u201cfewer than 40 unique global organizations\u201d, and that it blocked access to compromised domains, suggesting that the campaign\u2019s attack vector is disabled.A month later, a separate Microsoft article labeled Midnight Blizzard \u201cthe most sophisticated nation-state attack in history\u201d.Just weeks before this incident, on June 21 this year, Microsoft took to Twitter to warn its customers about Midnight Blizzard, saying the group ramped up its credential attack activity.Midnight Blizzard is focused on cyber-espionage and data harvesting, Microsoft explained, with firms in government, non-government organizations (NGOs), IT services, technology, discrete manufacturing, and media sectors being the primary targets.More than 3,000 malicious emails were sent at the time, with at least a quarter of victims being involved in international development, humanitarian and human rights work.Microsoft has been quite vocal in its tracking of the group.In some cases, NOBELIUM also targeted firms whose systems are protected with multi-factor authentication.\u201cThese credential attacks use a variety of password spray, brute force, and token theft techniques.\u201cThese attacks target governments, IT service providers, NGOs, defense industry, and critical manufacturing,\u201d the tweet reads.Midnight Blizzard is using a wide array of common techniques in its campaigns, the report concludes, adding that the group doesn\u2019t shy away from adding new techniques and advanced approaches to the attacks.Apparently, it\u2019s being run by the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation - SVR.Without going into too much detail, Microsoft said that the threat actors managed to make it past MFA by tricking the victims into sharing the time-based key on time.Russian military hackers are reportedly using compromised Microsoft 365 accounts to target businesses in the United States, and have so far successfully breached up to 40 firms.A new report from Microsoft\u2019s researchers claims to have spotted a group they track as Midnight Blizzard (also known as NOBELIUM, or Cozy Bear) - a known Russian state-sponsored threat actor.In newer times, it became globally famous by behind behind the infamous SolarWinds attack.What have others said about Midnight Blizzard?In May 2021, CNBC reported of Russia\u2019s Nobelium using USAID\u2019s email system to distribute phishing messages.Compromised businesses have been notified, the company added.Apparently, the group has been using Microsoft 365 accounts, belonging to various small businesses across the country and stolen in earlier attacks, to target specific firms with phishing messages and social engineering lures distributed through Microsoft Teams.It can also serve as a payload dropper.Analysis: Why does it matter?Midnight Blizzard is enough of a danger to be on the radar of US and UK governments.The goal of Midnight Blizzard\u2019s work is to gather intelligence and learn as much as possible about the inner workings of diplomats in the West.BoomBox is a malware dropper, used to drop the two remaining names on the list - NativeZone and VaporRage.These hackers usually target high-profile individuals such as politicians and diplomats, journalists, intellectuals, and others, but they also target IT service providers and critical infrastructure providers.\u201cWe believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers\u2019 IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization\u2019s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers,\u201d he explained at the time.At the time, Burt explained the recent activity as a fresh indicator of Russia trying to gain \u201clong-term, systematic access\u201d to a variety of points in the technology supply chain.Apparently, the hackers were impersonating tech support staff and tried to get their victims to share login credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) keys with them.The first traces of Midnight Blizzard\u2019s existence go back to 2018, Microsoft says, adding that in many cases, the group looks to compromise valid accounts and use them to go deeper into the rabbit hole.The group is mostly interested in entities residing in the West, either in Europe or in the United States.Given the current situation surrounding Ukraine, but other places where Russia might have some influence, like Niger, intelligence-gathering work is as important as it ever was.In the past, the group was observed using Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) malware named FOGGYWEB and MAGICWEB.Go deeperIf you want to learn more, make sure to read our earlier coverage of Nobelium, especially the SolarWinds hack.You should also make sure to read our in-depth guides for best firewalls, and best endpoint protection tools around.So far, the group was observed using EnvyScout, BoomBox, NativeZone, and VaporRage, as part of its toolset.As explained by BleepingComputer, EnvyScout is a malicious HTML/JS file attachment used in spear-phishing emails used to grab NTLM credentials of Windows accounts.While the majority of the targets were located in the United States, the victims were scattered across 24 different countries.In October 2021, Tom Burt - Corporate Vice President, Customer Security & Trust at Microsoft - published a blog post on the group\u2019s latest activity, arguing that the threat actor was behind the 2020 SolarWinds attack, as well.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Apple started experimenting with the USD format years ago, back when its adoption was more focused on the film industry.Meta didn\u2019t reply to our request for comment.Pixar open sourced USD in 2016, but even prior to that, people were optimistic about it becoming the industry standard format in the 3D content creation pipeline.The Metaverse Standards Forum \u2014 a group formed last year by Meta, Maxon, Epic Games, Autodesk, Nvidia, Adobe, and several other companies with a vested interest in metaverse technology \u2014 is even already reviewing USD\u2019s current capabilities (pdf).The future does seem bright for USD.Creators can use USD to collaborate on the same scene or project simultaneously, and any changes made to part of that environment will be reflected across everything else that references it.In June, Apple finally revealed its long-rumored Vision Pro headset, which lets users see immersive 3D worlds on an extremely premium device.USD itself has been around for a while.It is, however, the frontrunner for actually being adopted as the industry standard over rivaling formats like Alembic because it can be scaled for incredibly complex development pipelines.The group says it will \u201cdevelop written specifications detailing the features of OpenUSD,\u201d which it says will \u201cenable greater compatibility and wider adoption, integration, and implementation, and allows inclusion by other standards bodies into their specifications.\u201d\n\nThere are some absences in Tuesday\u2019s announcement, however: Meta, which makes Quest headsets, and the triumvirate of Google, Samsung, and Qualcomm, who are working on a new XR platform.USD is, essentially, a file format for encoding 3D scenes, but describing it in such simple terms undersells its significance.There seems to be momentum behind what the Alliance for OpenUSD is working on.And if it does win the race for 3D standardization, it\u2019ll be bright across every industry it can be applied to.But that\u2019s not only going to be on Apple; the company\u2019s also looking to developers to make great apps for the headset.Plus, since Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has signaled that he wants the company to represent the Android of the metaverse \u2014 \u201cthe open ecosystem for the next generation of computing around virtual and augmented reality in the metaverse more broadly,\u201d he told our colleague Alex Heath last year \u2014 you\u2019d think Meta would be jumping up and down to be a part of this.Unity is on board, too, according to Allan Poore, SVP of Unity W\u0113t\u0101 Tools.\u201cAnything that helps that is good.\u201d By 2022, USD was going more mainstream.At WWDC 2018, the company announced a new AR file format called USDZ for AR content in iOS apps like Messages and Safari.\u201cProprietary 3D formats [are] still a pretty big problem,\u201d one commenter wrote in a Hacker News thread from nearly a decade ago.RelatedZuckerberg is all in on the metaverse whether you like it or not\n\nMeta is a particularly notable missing party.Many industry standard applications like Autodesk\u2019s Maya, Adobe\u2019s Substance 3D, and Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse platform already support USD, and these companies have thrown their weight behind its standardization.(Though you probably won\u2019t hear Apple use the word \u201cmetaverse\u201d to describe anything you can experience with its products.)At the time, Apple was working with Pixar, Adobe, and Autodesk on the new format.There\u2019s just one problem: someone needs to build those worlds, and building them requires a lot of work.The Alliance for OpenUSD \u2014 a group formed by Apple, Pixar, Adobe, Autodesk, and Nvidia \u2014 aims to standardize and develop a technology called Universal Scene Description (USD) that was originally made by Pixar.The technology lets developers move their work across a world of 3D creation tools, making it much easier for developers to build 3D experiences for everything from VFX and animation (where it\u2019s already been widely adopted) to gaming, VR, and metaverse applications.Creating 3D content for movies and games involves generating, storing, and transmitting large quantities of data \u2014 known as \u201cscene description.\u201d Various applications are required in this pipeline for things like modeling, lighting, animation, shading, and rendering, and these typically use their own specialized form of scene description that can\u2019t be edited or even read by other apps.USD isn\u2019t the only \u201cstandardized\u201d format available, nor is it a new development.In a blog post, Nvidia wrote that it believed \u201cUSD should serve as the HTML of the metaverse: the declarative specification of the contents of a web site.\u201d\n\nThe new alliance could make some kind of HTML-level adoption more feasible.So to help make it easier to build that 3D content, Apple has teamed up with a bunch of big companies working in 3D tech to announce an alliance that could change the way 3D projects are made.Apple has a lot to gain from the adoption of USD\n\nApple in particular has a lot to gain from the widespread adoption of OpenUSD.And if Apple has the apps that convince people to buy its headsets over others \u2014 say, those from Meta \u2014 it could become a leader in yet another big technology.The USD format solves this problem by enabling 3D tools across the development pipeline to \u201ccommunicate,\u201d allowing various formats to be compiled together.Meta is already pushing for the adoption of standard formats for building virtual worlds and metaverses.The company is burning cash to make the metaverse happen, and its support would go a long way toward standardization around 3D asset creation.Now, as Apple tries to find ways to support expansive 3D content for the Vision Pro, getting more involved with standardizing USD seems like a logical step.(And Apple and Pixar go way back thanks in part to Steve Jobs.)Should creative tools adopt it en masse, it could help developers more easily build 3D apps for the Vision Pro headset, a rumored cheaper version down the line, and, should they ever come out, some kind of AR glasses.Perhaps that all comes down to the fact that Apple is such a big part of the alliance.Epic Games, which makes the popular Unreal Engine suite of development tools, is \u201cexcited to witness the [alliance\u2019s] formation,\u201d according to Marc Petit, the company\u2019s VP of the Unreal Engine ecosystem.",

            "paraphrased_content": "In response, there\u2019s a new ranked gameplay system, too, giving the game\u2019s most dedicated players better matches (hopefully) with scoring based on the hidden \u201cMMR\u201d score that tracks how good you actually are.Newly fitted with an Extended Sniper Mag attachment slot and boasting a number of changes to its firing mechanisms, Legends familiar with the anti-Titan model available during the Frontier Wars should feel right at home.It will make climbing to a higher masters rank slower, according to the developers, but it should make finding games faster and more rewarding.In addition, a new tactical ability, \u201cShadow Pounce,\u201d lets him close gaps in a blink.Image: EA\n\nRevenant\u2019s updated abilities (along with his look) allow him to always see any nearby low-health enemies as a passive ability to go with his existing faster crouch walk and improved wall climb.And then there are some things, such as modes or changes in mechanics, that just take a longer runway to develop.Said EA Entertainment president Laura Miele:\n\nOn Apex, the way to think about it is when you \u2014 when we have these live services, and I laid out the areas of expansion of new addressable audiences and players, geographic expansion, and then monetization conversion mechanics that will evolve over time, we think about and look at the Apex development cycle and candidly, most live services cycles as short, mid and long-term.And we expect to see even bigger, more impactful changes in 19 and 20 and into the future for the following year.With an increasingly crowded market including other shooters like Overwatch 2 and the Call of Duty juggernaut, season 17 was enough of a disappointment financially that it earned a mention in EA\u2019s quarterly earnings slide:\n\nAccelerating EA Sports FIFA franchise growth and release of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, partially offset by lower-than-expected performance of Apex Season 17\n\nStill, according to executives on the earnings call (PDF), while season 17\u2019s performance \u201cdidn\u2019t meet our expectations,\u201d the game still has 18 million active monthly players and a retention rate of over 70 percent.Image: EA\n\nAs a battle royale shooter, Apex Legends corrals surviving players together throughout the round with a closing ring that deals damage to anyone caught in it, and the ranked mode will add new tweaks to the damage and timing of its closing to discourage players from trying to outheal its damage and avoid encountering other players to place higher.Jump into Gun Run and Team Deathmatch in The Core or play Control in the Production Yard.Season 17 added a well-received new character in Ballistic and brought some needed changes to maps like World\u2019s Edge, plus a new firing range area to train in.The game-as-a-service model means walking a careful tightrope of evolving in real time along with players\u2019 changing expectations, growing the game\u2019s audience with new players who don\u2019t have years of experience and money invested, and also somehow not changing things too much.More than four years after its explosive launch shook up the battle royale market, Apex Legends is looking for yet another fresh start (no, that fresh start doesn\u2019t include any updates about cross-progression or 120fps on consoles) when its new season, Resurrection, launches on August 8th at 1PM ET.(Although Miele did name-drop it on the earnings call, saying, \u201cRemember, Apex is set in the Titanfall world.So again, there\u2019s a lot the team can do and what they have levers on.Also launching on August 8th are:\n\nMixtape on Broken MoonMixtape crashes into Broken Moon, bringing fan-favorite Mixtape modes to new locations this season.In the new season, the Apex developers are undertaking a campaign to rework and revisit existing elements, starting with one of the game\u2019s older characters, Revenant.Finally, the lead-up to this season brought along a very Titanfall 2-ish story mission, Kill Code, that I didn\u2019t enjoy based on its jumping puzzle structure but presented an interesting teaser to players who\u2019ve been craving for something more single-player-flavored, especially in light of a reportedly canceled single-player spinoff and no sign of a new Titanfall game waiting in the wings.No longer does the infamous weapon fire a sustained beam.There\u2019s a lot of demand and interest in this universe.\u201d) The mission and storyline also added elements to the main game that dropped higher-tier items for assisting the characters in their mission by visiting particular spots on the map.Legends can show their skill as the darkness closes in.Death Dynasty Collection EventEmbody the essence of death with the Death Dynasty Collection Event.During the event, players earn double XP in Battle Royale from August 8-15 and in Mixtape from August 15-22.On the earnings call this week, executives from EA said the game would \u201cintroduce new modes of play across various markets,\u201d and hopefully, that means more than just bringing out a new mobile title to replace the one that was unceremoniously canceled or adding more items and characters to increase appeal internationally.This season, Respawn is also making Revenant available for free so players who haven\u2019t unlocked him can try out his abilities, and if they complete a set of challenges, they will unlock him for free permanently.So you will see some \u2014 we will see some adjustments and changes in Season 18.The lore of Apex Legends has always been a bit of a sleeping giant, and leaning into that with experiences that are playable could help it continue to stick out from the crowd.Notice something weird?And to replace his old ultimate, which gave players temporary shadow clones to attack with, the \u201cForged Shadows\u201d ultimate now gives a shield that blocks damage and can regenerate, with refreshed shadows and tactical ability each time you knock down another player while using it.Unfortunately, it also added enough scoring changes to the ranked system that an unprecedented number of players were able to achieve high ranks by \u201cratting,\u201d or avoiding fights until late game, that it affected the game\u2019s balance.Legends that unlock all 24 cosmetics will automatically be rewarded with Revenant\u2019s new \u201cDeath Grip\u201d heirloom.Charge Rifle UpdateThe Charge Rifle has been re-designed for immediate use in the Apex Games.Chart of Apex Legends ranked players in season 17.Ideally, if Respawn adds more integrations, they\u2019ll be more like this, as it added to gameplay without sending teams and teammates on a longer wild goose chase like some previous in-game activations.",

            "paraphrased_content": "The Ayaneo Air 1S, a more compact 7840-based handheld, has been announced.While Ayaneo competes with the likes of Valve and ASUS on a technical level, in most other ways, the company is more of an upstart in the world of gaming hardware.The difference is more in the power profile/TDP you need to get that enjoyable experience.The Ayaneo 2S is available in multiple configurations that start where the Ally does and go right up to 64GB RAM and a cavernous 4TB of storage.For the Ayaneo 2, I had to dial it up to around 15W to achieve a steady 60, or 10W for \u201calmost\u201d 60.Not to mention the dizzying amount of different configurations within each of those, meaning Ayaneo probably has more SKUs than all of its competitors put together.The two portable PCs have a lot in common: They both have 7-inch displays, they both run Windows 11, they both sport Zen 4-based AMD APUs and they both want to draw your attention away from the cheaper, older, bigger, but fan-favorite Steam Deck.Ayaneo looks set to continue to cater for those who are willing to pay for the latest and greatest, but it\u2019s also at risk of alienating those users by making their $1,200 handheld feel last-gen in just seven months.In general the gaming experience on the 2S is superior, as you would hope, to that of the original Ayaneo 2.Broadly speaking, both can handle most games, even demanding AAA titles at very playable frame rates.With the 2S, it\u2019s possible to break the five hour mark if you\u2019re frugal \u2014 of course this also means disabling wireless, lowering the screen brightness and so on, but it\u2019s a marked improvement.I could even dial it down to 8W and it\u2019d hover between 55 and 60 fps.$999+ for a gaming handheld is a huge spend for most people.ASUS entering the handheld space has added credibility to the portable PC gaming space, perhaps creating a stepping stone between the dependability and smoother UI of the Steam Deck and the tech-heavy, but less refined experience of Ayaneo products.With games like Red Dead Redemption 2 or Cyberpunk 2077, the difference is more pronounced.It\u2019s with these less-demanding titles where the new processor\u2019s efficiency most noticeably translates into extra battery life.It doesn\u2019t do an amazing job of hiding Windows from you \u2014 you\u2019ll regularly find yourself navigating the desktop with the analog sticks or touchscreen.Cosmetically the two are almost identical bar some larger vent holes on the 2S.That\u2019s not to be confused with the Air Pro and the Air Plus.It\u2019s important to note, though, that even the most affordable Zen 4-based Ayaneo starts at $999 (or $699 if you\u2019re quick enough to bag an early bird) compared to the Ally\u2019s relative affordability (starting at $699).At the moment, the company\u2019s fans appear to enjoy the rapid-fire approach to releases.Or not.One of the reasons the Steam Deck has remained so popular despite new, \u201csuperior\u201d competition from Ayaneo and ASUS etc.So when ASUS announced the ROG Ally, Ayaneo probably didn\u2019t like losing a superlative claim (of being more powerful than Valve\u2019s competition).Photo by James Trew / Engadget\nEither way, the new, more powerful processor is really what makes the 2S interesting.The 2S was able to crank out closer to 40 peak fps with a minimum over 30 at the same power setting.The general user interface seems much slicker and more lightweight which feels much more in tune with what you might expect from a console experience.Especially if there\u2019s a launcher between you and the game \u2014 as EA/Rockstar/Ubisoft titles tend to have.On the Steam Deck, for example, these are handled slightly better, but on the Ayaneo platform it can be ugly with different windows popping up.But there\u2019s still the matter of price.For example, on the 2S, I was able to get The Witcher 3 to run at a steady 60 fps (\u201cSteam Deck\u201d settings at 800p) with an 11W TDP setting.Predictably, the Ayaneo 2S is a great gaming handheld that outperforms most of its rivals in several key areas.With the Ayaneo 2, at lower TDP settings battery life seems to hover a little over the four hour mark (depending on the game being played).The displays might be the same size, but the 2S has a 1200p resolution (ASUS\u2019s is 1080p), the 2S has a larger battery (50Wh vs 40) and the Ally is only available with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.Some benchmarks even suggest that the Ayaneo 2S consistently bests the performance of the ROG ALLY with like for like settings.This could simply be down to differences in drivers for the new chipsets, but as YouTuber The Phawx points out, modern games often require a lot of VRAM, and APUs like the 7840U lean on system RAM for that, making the higher spec of the Ayaneo a clear advantage.Once above 15W I didn\u2019t notice significant gains in battery life.At least, for now, the next APU refresh from AMD isn\u2019t set for another year or so, so perhaps that\u2019s a chance for Ayaneo to catch its breath.The Ayaspace launcher itself rarely gets much praise, but I\u2019ve always found it functional and a nicer experience than just launching titles from the desktop.It\u2019ll handle almost any game you throw at it, and likely do so surprisingly well.But one that has earned a dedicated army of fans thanks to its spec-heavy approach to product design.For the most part you can boot up and get into a game quickly, but the specter of Microsoft\u2019s operating system is never far away.If you\u2019re less worried about playing heavyweight games, and prefer indie titles or older/lighter games then the 2S really shines, being able to run things like Hades, Trine, Return of the Obra Dinn, Hotline Miami and so on at full/high quality settings without even flinching.This represents a modest, but important upgrade in performance \u2014 but every game is different.Most of the other upgrades are to do with cooling, including a graphene patch that has been added and the aforementioned airflow design.There\u2019s also a minor tweak to the triggers that stop them making a noise when fully depressed and an improved fingerprint reader.That said, if you\u2019re now able to play a game at 15W that needed 20W of power on an older model, there\u2019s obviously an inherent power saving there, but at like-for-like wattages, these Windows handhelds are still incredibly power hungry.Ayaneo has been broadly praised for its hardware and performance since it entered the scene, it\u2019s the software side of things where people seem to have the most complaints.is that it\u2019s relatively affordable.Importantly, you\u2019ll be able to do so at a much lower TDP \u2014 even as low as 5W for many of the above titles.Dial the 2S up to 22W TDP and you can expect over 60 fps no problem.Sadly, those gains don\u2019t seem to scale up at the high end.The Ayaneo 2S does best the ROG Ally in a few important areas though.The short version is, there are good gains to be had, but if you were considering the 6800U-based Ayaneo, that\u2019s still a capable performer \u2014 and now a more affordable one.Photo by James Trew / Engadget\nIt\u2019s hard to do several side by side comparisons for all games and different situations, but it\u2019s easy to see that the 7840U presents a significant upgrade in performance at the higher end.The Ayaneo 2S isn\u2019t just the Ayaneo 2 with a new 7840U processor, but that is by far the most important difference.There is, of course, a question mark over how long Ayaneo can keep this up without alienating its fans, or even over-stretching its own resources.Just as they\u2019re about to stop salivating over the latest product, another one pops up on the horizon.It doesn\u2019t take long with the 2S before you\u2019re reminded that you\u2019re basically holding a desktop.We only just reviewed the ROG Ally, and it\u2019s already been dethroned as the \u201cmost powerful handheld gaming PC yet.\u201d Or at least, it\u2019s going to have to scoot over a little and let the Ayaneo 2S squeeze in.Perhaps the bigger problem for the 2S, or Ayaneo owners in general, is that\u2026 even in the time between starting this review and finishing it the company\u2019s lineup has changed.Photo by James Trew / Engadget\nThe better news is that Ayaneo has just made version 2.0 of its launcher available for download and it looks promising.I was only able to spend a short amount of time with it, but aesthetically it feels like an improvement with more controls and settings closer to hand.Then there\u2019s the Ayaneo Kun, a new, new flagship that\u2019s all new, including an 8-inch display and Steam Deck-like touchpads.A new processor is only as good as the performance boost it brings, and even that has to be weighed against any extra tax on the battery (which remains the same 50.25Wh capacity as the original Ayaneo 2).The Ayaneo 2 was able to serve up around mid-20 fps for both of these games at 15W TDP at 1200p.",

KellyBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 Romance Guide \u2013 Love In The Time Of MindflayersTake Your Time During Character Creation\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 features a deep character creation system that allows you to customize pretty much every aspect of your character, from appearance to race, class, background, attributes, and more.With so many possibilities, however, some players may feel overwhelmed by the game, especially if they are not D&D hardcore fans and have never played a similar game before.Use Quicksave to avoid losing too much progress as often as you can, and have fun playing with an incredibly dynamic world that wants you to find unique answers to the many questions it poses!Baldur's Gate 3 is chockfull of similar situations, so don't be afraid to experiment.If you try to be friendly with the goblins and use your party's skills to avoid conflict, however, you can reach the three leaders without having to fight an entire army of angry goblins and study some creative ways to get rid of them.Pro-tip: try shoving Dror Ragzlin while he is sitting on his throne.Being able to do so requires a little bit of D&D knowledge, so make sure to take your time when creating your character to research the best possible combinations and have an easier time during the early game.If you are among these players who are struggling to understand the basics of the Baldur's Gate 3 experience, you have journeyed to the right place, as the following tips will help you understand the game better and enjoy it more right from the start of your adventure to prevent yourself from turning into a mind flayer, or worse.While going in the camp spells-blazing sounds fun, it will pit you against the entire camp, making it difficult to reach the three leaders and kill them.Despite not being exactly an open-world sandbox experience, the game allows players to clear quest objectives in any way they like, and thinking outside the box and experimenting is always the way to go to make some fun discoveries.Share this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n TwitterThink Outside the Box\n\nOften during your time in Baldur's Gate 3, you will think that violence is a decent enough answer to your troubles, but that is hardly the case.While cRPGs often grant players huge amounts of freedom to tackle main objectives any way they want, Baldur's Gate 3 brings everything up a notch, giving players almost complete freedom right from the very start of the campaign.Abuse Quicksave\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 features an extremely dynamic world where anything can happen at any time.As such, you will want to form a balanced party, with an attacker/tank who can take more than a few hits and retaliate in kind, a supporting character who can heal and buff other party members, such as a Cleric, and long-range attackers who can take advantage of higher ground to attack enemies while staying out of harm's way.You may be strolling through a peaceful forest and get attacked all of a sudden by a fearsome creature, or you may be walking around a village minding your own business and then get forced into an interaction that may result in a battle.Explore, Explore, and then Explore Some More\n\nThe world of Baldur's Gate 3 is filled with items to collect, and you should definitely pick up every item you can see lying around or highlighted by pressing the alt key or the right stick on your controller (unless you are stealing from someone).It's not the most natural way to play the game, for sure, but it works quite well and comes with no penalties, so there's no real reason to err on the side of caution and save as often as possible.While most of the items you will find around aren't particularly useful, many of them are, such as scrolls, food items that can be used to restore your part during Long Rests, weapons, throwable items, and more.As such, it is always a very good idea to save as much as possible by using the Quicksave option, which is easy to access with both keyboard and mouse controls and a controller.Form a Balanced Party\n\nDespite Baldur's Gate 3 not being extremely challenging, at least at Balanced difficulty, more often than not, you will find yourself at a disadvantage when fighting enemies, as you will have to deal with multiple enemies with just your four characters.Quicksave can also be used during battles and conversations, so if you're unsure a bold strategy will pay off, you can reload a previous save to change your approach in case something goes wrong.Best case, you will have found a rare weapon or gear that could carry you through the toughest battles.Generally speaking, there are no truly bad combinations, so you can probably beat the game at Explorer and Balanced difficulty with any character, but if you want to make the best out of them, you will want to go for certain races and class combinations, so as to get the class' primary Ability Score to 16 to unlock bonuses such as +1 to Attack Rolls and so on without being forced to create an unbalanced character.Depending on your companions and how you have customized them, you can make it out alive from most fights with any party combination, so experiment as much as you can to find out what works best for you.Worst case, you can simply sell the items you do not need to merchants to get some extra gold, which is always useful to have.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Almost all of the early beats in Mutant Mayhem\u2019s script from Rowe, producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit feel like the movie checking off a list of TMNT basics for newcomers.With there being so many different modern takes on the characters first created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, it wasn\u2019t all that clear what more that could be done with them that 4Kids, Warner Bros., Nickelodeon, and parent company Paramount hadn\u2019t already tried multiple times over.Image: Paramount\n\nOccasionally, Mutant Mayhem might feel a bit too packed with pop culture and brand references for its own good \u2014 particularly to older theatergoers who lived through previous corporate marketing blitzes designed to turn people into lifelong Turtles fans.Unlike the Turtles, who \u2014 despite being unique in small ways \u2014 all share a recognizable symmetrical wholeness, basically every single human who appears in Mutant Mayhem is rendered as a kind of artfully bizarre nightmare person whose faces all feel like reflections of the city (and humanity\u2019s) ugliness.There has seldom been a moment during the past 20 years when there wasn\u2019t a relatively new spin on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles airing on TV, playing in movie theaters, or appearing in comic books, which is part of what made director Jeff Rowe\u2019s Mutant Mayhem animated feature such a curious surprise when it was first announced.Mutant Mayhem\u2019s Turtles are still a gaggle of sewer-dwelling teenage boys who don\u2019t clean behind their ears because they\u2019re not entirely sure if they have them.But it breezes through them with a swift and stylish precision that telegraphs Rowe and co-director Kyler Spears\u2019 razor-sharp sense for crafting the bigger, busier action sequences that come later on and brilliantly showcases Arthur Fong and Tiffany Lam Almack\u2019s absolutely stunning art direction.But it\u2019s not at all the case with high school student April O\u2019Neil (Ayo Edebiri), whose chance encounter with the Turtles one evening gives them all hope that they might finally have a shot at making some real new friends.The movie\u2019s in theaters now.But between the movie\u2019s delightfully grimy art direction, its hyper-kinetic action sequences, and its quintet of strong, pointedly youthful lead performances, Mutant Mayhem is also hands down one of the most exciting and definitive outings the Ninja Turtles have ever had.It\u2019s as true of the innocent strangers the Turtles sneak by during their bodega runs as it is of \u200b\u200bCynthia Utrom (Maya Rudolph) \u2014 the villainous head of the research lab desperately trying to replicate the process that led to the mutagenic ooze\u2019s creation.Set largely in the slime-filled sewers of New York City, Mutant Mayhem tells the slightly updated story of how Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), Raphael (Brady Noon), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) grew up to become pizza-munching, anthropomorphic, reptilian crime fighters after being exposed to mutagenic ooze as ordinary baby turtles.Image: Paramount\n\nAfter years of living in secret and being raised by their similarly mutated adoptive rat-turned-father figure, Splinter (Jackie Chan), the boys all know just how dangerous the surface and the humans who call it home can be for people who aren\u2019t considered \u201cnormal.\u201d But as teenage boys who\u2019ve spent their entire lives being forced to hide in the shadows and made to practice their ninjutsu arts strictly for self-defense, the brothers can\u2019t help but be curious about the bright, bustling world above that\u2019s always been just out of their reach.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem also stars Ice Cube, Giancarlo Esposito, Seth Rogen, John Cena, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, Natasia Demetriou, Post Malone, and Paul Rudd.It\u2019s exactly the sort of vibe that a reboot meant to kick off a new era of films and spinoff series should have, and while it remains to be seen whether Paramount can really keep this momentum going long term, with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, the studio\u2019s absolutely knocked it out of the park.But everything about Mutant Mayhem\u2019s quippy sense of humor, its scribbly / sketchy visual language, and its focus on the Turtles\u2019 obsession with the surface is meant to remind you that \u2014 in addition to being mutant ninjas \u2014 they\u2019re a bunch of goofy kids that actual children are meant to be able to relate to in an organic way.While the Ninja Turtles have been varying degrees of cute, \u201ccool,\u201d and alarming, throughout their almost 40-year-long history, there\u2019s always been an innate ick factor to them that\u2019s a big part of their appeal.Narratively, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is such a classic and straightforward Turtle tale that it\u2019ll ring almost too familiar to anyone who knows the heroes in a half shell \u2014 especially those who\u2019ve kept up with the franchise over the past couple of years.But one of Mutant Mayhem\u2019s most brilliant moves is the way it parlays the TMNT brand\u2019s classic grossness into a more expansive grotesque aesthetic that defines the entire world around the Turtles, but \u2014 interestingly \u2014 not the Turtles themselves.",

            "paraphrased_content": "In this time, I\u2019ve managed to put 50 hours into it, and while I haven\u2019t seen the end of the story, I\u2019m happy enough with what I\u2019ve played to score it and recommend it thoroughly.Spell slots often feel anti-fun, really.The game itself is also an incredibly accurate rendition of the Dungeons & Dragons system, so Larian\u2019s role is actually as the dungeon master (DM) while you get to grips with the systems.As my ranger, I didn\u2019t have that level of musical talent, so instead talked through the feelings with her, and she worked it out for herself.Early on, hitting even low-level enemies is tricky due to how the game\u2019s chance to hit interacts with the way defence is handled with armour class.Code came in on Sunday the 31st of July, and here we are publishing the review on Thursday, August 3.Suddenly, that\u2019s the case in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3.I\u2019ll be jumping back in tonight, and tomorrow, and probably repeatedly for the next few weeks.Much like Dungeons & Dragons itself, this is a story that feels tailored to your actions within it.As a result, my cleric often feels like they\u2019re just scrapping with their mace and shield, waiting for the moment I need them to cast a spell to keep me alive or, at later levels, bust out a revive spell to bring a dead character back from the void.It's not just the story.Considering the max level is 12, each level achieved will feel genuinely quite momentous.Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, more than anything else, is a game that rewards diligence.There\u2019s more here than most games to tweak your options, including a toggle for showing genitals and nudity.This works with the combat too.If I was more heartless, I could have instead opted to smash the lute.As someone with a level of sentience barely higher than Scratch\u2019s, Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 manages to make me feel like both an idiot and a genius, but it\u2019s never anything less than compelling.I\u2019ve been playing Dungeons & Dragons for years, and the system has always annoyed me a little bit, because it turns the cool things your character can do into a finite resource and encourages you to horde them, like how you don\u2019t use your most potent spells just in case you need them later.It\u2019s that good, and I wish you luck in your adventures.Each day, you\u2019ll get a small selection of spell slots you can fire off before you need to take a long rest to replenish them.Someone you convince to embrace their most heroic self in one act may appear later, or you might hear of their heroic sacrifice, saving those around them at great personal cost.Bear in mind that in D&D parlance, by the time you get to levels 13-14, you\u2019re just about ready to punch a god in the face.These cantrips can be cast at any time without limit, and similar \u201ctadpole powers\u201d given by the introduction of Mindflayer parasites you can find from powerful enemies will allow you to trade your humanity in exchange for psionic abilities or the chance to get advantage in your rolls against specific people.Talking to everyone and exploring everywhere will turn up various options.Adventure is out there(Image credit: Larian Studios)Let\u2019s address the elephant in the room to finish off the review.Being able to do all of this makes Baldur's Gate 3 feel more like a tabletop game and it is to the game's credit.Failing that, you might even be able to resolve the trap using brainpower, moving barrels to block grates that spew poison gas or building a small pile of crates to catch a lethal projectile before it can hit you.If this feels like a lot, prepare to start overthinking.My character has the power to act against that in a multitude of ways.This little stories will often be repaid.Then even after they had generated their magic clones, I could identify the right one by seeing who was still dripping wet.This wasn\u2019t enough to get through the game, and I'm still in the early to mid stages of Act 2, but it\u2019s more than enough to get a sense of the sprawling scale and depth of the game here.We'd say that Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best RPGs ever, but if you're on the hunt for the next adventure with some companions we've got a list of the best MMOs too.This can unfold in several different ways, but each feels reasonable.Accessibility features\u00a0(Image credit: Larian)You can customise your input mode, length of button presses, subtitles, and all sorts of things here.Better, even if I find the \u201cthe grove should remain pure for the druids\u201d argument personally reprehensible, I can see how the situation got to this point.But you can exchange your hard-earned cash for the game right now, and so it\u2019s important to put a score on it so you know if it\u2019s worth it.The characters are rich and well-written, and this means that the world has weight to it: an early game argument between a druidic grove and the Tiefling refugees that are hiding there from goblins feels like it actually matters because you can see the fear of the Tieflings when they talk about getting ejected, and feel the anger of the druids that have adopted a fierce isolationist stance.For Wizards, you get to choose the subclass of magic you want to be really good at.Scratch isn\u2019t the only character I\u2019ve developed an emotional attachment to over the last few days with Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, but if you held a heavy crossbow (1D10 damage plus your dex modifier) to my head, then Scratch would be the most unexpected delight from the game.That fur ball is cheating, though: Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 gives the best lines to the animals.For many puzzles you can even talk or puzzle your way out.Many magic-damaging classes have cantrips that increase their efficacy as your character's level.People unfamiliar with D&D\u2019s weird quirks and foibles may have a rough time.I\u2019m often glancing at my toolbar and imagining my more powerful spells locked away behind imaginary glass, to be broken in case of emergency.Still, it is a faithful adaptation, so these annoyances are annoyances that tabletop fans have also had for years.Whether you want to add backgrounds to subtitles, tweak the size of your subtitles, or even just force mono audio if that\u2019s more helpful.Otherwise, for most players, this is one of the best RPGs ever made, and I stand by the score it\u2019s received.When you get to 12, you should be looking for the nearest dungeon or dragon to solo as a show of your power.Does the trick(Image credit: Larian Studios)Then there\u2019s also Baldur\u2019s Gate 3\u2019s spell slot system, which is actually D&D\u2019s spell slot system.Similarly, because the tabletop game tries to deliver on the dungeon crawling experience in the smoothest way possible, you won\u2019t actually get to do extraordinary things with your character until level three, which is when your character will choose their specialisation and start to feel like a distinct character.Whether you\u2019re chatting to Scratch, several rats in various stages of misadventure, or even a couple of spiders imprisoned inside a goblin camp, these interactions are often the best in the game, and alternate between hilarious and tragic, often with just a moment's notice.Patience is a virtue(Image credit: Larian Studios)Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 is, undeniably, a Larian game.If it turns out that Baldur\u2019s Gate 3\u2019s final twist is that it ends as a kart racer, with you driving through the streets of the titular city itself like a modern-day Carmaggedon, then I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve steered you wrong.A street urchin you do a favour for will vouch for you later when you run into each other again.Or at least, that's the case for my current playthrough, though I've no doubt the moving parts will become more apparent on later playthroughs.You can charge headlong into a trap with your meaty melee character, or you can solve it with a rogue by disarming it.Fighting an illusionist who could create magic illusions of themselves and also turn invisible was at first tricky until I realised I could find the hidden version by throwing bottles of water around until I found the invisible enemy.The dungeons that make up a lot of Baldur's Gate 3 aren't just fighting either.There\u2019s a lot here I haven\u2019t discussed, and I won\u2019t pretend to have finished the game.Playing as a bard in co-op I was able to teach Alfira, a lute-playing druid, how to sing a song that helps her process the grief she\u2019s feeling after the death of a friend.Why would I dare to use a damage-dealing spell when I can use those spell slots to keep my party alive during some difficult combat encounters?How we reviewed\u00a0I played one character for 50 hours on PC.Not every class was created equally in terms of what they get when they level, but each level feels instantly more interesting than most other games.However, if you're looking to take your next journey solo, our list of the best single-player games will do the trick.For fighters, you might get to choose the champion subclass, which makes you fantastic at battering people, or the eldritch knight, which gets to add spells to their big fighty repertoire.For a cleric, this takes on even more significance.I would die for Scratch, an adorable dog you meet in the opening hours of Larian\u2019s sprawling roleplaying game.If you\u2019ve bought into D&D\u2019s particular brand of ridiculousness, then hey, you\u2019ll find this is the exact game that you love, but in video game form.",

            "paraphrased_content": "That\u2019s not too surprising, though, as we are seeing more efforts to cram ads into Windows 11 \u2013 disguised as recommendations \u2013 lately.The AI remains pretty barebones, and as Microsoft makes clear, it only has a \u201cbasic set\u201d of Windows settings you can manipulate.But obviously, it\u2019s still a very unwelcome move in an operating system Microsoft charges you for.We\u2019d expect feedback to be pretty withering on this, particularly if, as it sounds, these will be more out-and-out adverts than what we\u2019ve already seen in Windows 11 (like badging in the Start menu).(Turning on dark mode, or do not disturb, or ordering Copilot to take a screenshot are a few examples of Windows 11 functionality given in the blog post).It's mostly still about the Bing AI summarizing things, or composing a picture, or writing text for you, and so forth \u2013 all the stuff that can be done already using the Bing chatbot on the web.Over time, more features will be added, of course \u2013 and third-party plug-ins will expand Copilot\u2019s functionality considerably \u2013 but all that seems quite a way down the line.With Windows 11\u2019s 23H2 update potentially arriving in October, that\u2019s really very close now, so we don\u2019t really get what Microsoft is planning here.Hopefully being the keyword there\u2026It feels like the full launch of Copilot will be a basic incarnation of the AI, if it happens, and that runs the risk of underwhelming with first impressions.Microsoft tells us: \u201cYou may see inline recommendations we think are relevant through ads in Bing.Rumors have indicated that Copilot could land with the 23H2 update, and this makes it look like that\u2019s more likely to happen \u2013 even though we\u2019ve said in the past we don\u2019t think it will.We\u2019re still very unsure if it\u2019s wise for Microsoft to push this hard getting Copilot out so quickly, though.And so hopefully Microsoft will have to take that into account, and curtail these ambitions.We\u2019re told that \u201cadditional functionality [is] coming down the road in future previews.\u201dAlso, it should be noted that Copilot will be a \u201ccontrolled feature rollout\u201d meaning only a small amount of testers will get it initially.(In order to help correct words that are misheard, or mistyped, as it were, by the voice recognition system \u2013 like putting \u2018cereal\u2019 when you meant \u2018serial\u2019 for example).Check out Microsoft\u2019s blog post for the full list of changes.It\u2019ll arrive for more folks in the \u201ccoming weeks\u201d, so this is a rollout that could take some time.(As the AI is powered via Edge, you definitely won\u2019t get it on an older version of the browser).For those who do receive Copilot, here comes that sting we mentioned at the outset.Microsoft is expanding the rollout of its Copilot AI to testers in the Beta channel for Windows 11 \u2013 but it comes with a sting in the tail.Copilot has arrived with Beta build 22631.2129, but as with the preview incarnation of the AI in earlier builds, it\u2019s in a limited form right now.As Microsoft observes, this is more about getting the integrated UI for Copilot right \u2013 it runs in a sidebar, to the right \u2013 rather than testing all its features.(It\u2019s also worth noting that not every Insider will get this build either \u2013 new testers, and a subset of existing testers, won\u2019t get 22631 as it might cause their device to be put \u201cinto a bad state\u201d, which sounds ominous).If you\u2019re not seeing Copilot and you\u2019re in the Beta channel, then, this isn\u2019t unexpected \u2013 but you should make sure you\u2019re running Microsoft Edge version 115.0.1901.150 or better.This relatively swift progress through test builds suggests that Microsoft is serious about getting the AI integrated into Windows 11 this year.We\u2019ll continue to learn and listen to customer feedback.\u201dYes, there we have it \u2013 adverts are going to be displayed in Copilot (we\u2019ll come back to discuss that more thoroughly in a moment).Elsewhere in build 22631, there\u2019s a raft of tweaks and improvements, including some fresh work on bolstering accessibility.(Image credit: Microsoft)Analysis: So, ads in Copilot \u2013 testers, make your feelings known\u2026Windows Copilot making it to a beta build already is a pretty big thing, actually.Oh well, we shall find out soon enough.As for Copilot serving up adverts, this is something that Microsoft has said in the past, but the software giant appears to be pushing ahead with this frankly reckless idea.That comes in the form of the ability to now use Voice Access on the lock screen, plus there are new text editing controls when using speech dictation.",

            "paraphrased_content": "\u201cIt\u2019s a really fun, exciting event.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s competition featured some of the biggest names in Excel: Diarmuid Early, a financial and data consultant who several people I spoke to referred to as \u201cthe Michael Jordan of Excel;\u201d Andrew Ngai, an actuary who is currently the top-ranked competitive Exceler in the world; David Brown, a University of Arizona professor who also leads a lot of the college-level Excel competitions; and more.It\u2019s the Sheeter Bowl!One case from last year\u2019s competition required each player to figure out all the possible outcomes and associated rewards for a slot machine; another required modeling how a videogame character might navigate through an Excel-based level.This year, there\u2019s a new wrinkle: it\u2019s an elimination race.And ultimately, those involved with Excel Esports say Excel knowledge is only part of the game.Sure, it helps to know all the latest coding and formula-creation tricks, and you\u2019re definitely going to need to be familiar with Excel\u2019s bottomless library of keyboard shortcuts.!\u2019 And so I\u2019m thinking about how to engage them, but not bore the hell out of them talking about the difference between an outer join versus doing an Xlookup.\u201d When he\u2019s not commentating on these matches, du Soleil teaches Excel for a living and runs a YouTube channel called Excel on Fire.But we\u2019ll get to that.Many are financial analysts of some kind, which also makes sense.For Grigolyunovich and the FMWC team, the hope is to one day not just get on ESPN during the network\u2019s day of silly sports but to be as popular and exciting as any other game you might watch.Whatever you want to call it, the Excel World Championship is coming back to ESPN this week.(Spoiler alert: Ngai ended up winning.)A lot of cases involve chess, elections, or random-character generators of some kind.This is all just one part of the competitive Excel world, too.The organization also runs educational programs for Excel users and a fast-growing competition for students.\u201cSo it\u2019s not necessarily just the person with the best Excel knowledge that\u2019s going to win \u2014 if you\u2019re a quick thinker and problem solver, you\u2019ll have an advantage as well.\u201d\n\nCompetitive Excel has been around for years, but last year\u2019s appearance on ESPN was something of an inflection point for the game.Merge Madness!This year\u2019s televised match is just one part of a longer season, leading up to the really big show: the Microsoft Excel World Championship Finals in Las Vegas this December.\u201cIf you ask the same question to five people who have Excel experience, they might think of five completely different ways to do it,\u201d says Peter Scharl, an actuarial consultant who got hooked on competitive Excel after watching it on ESPN last year and is now the 8th-ranked player in the FMWC standings.On Friday morning at 7AM ET, as part of ESPN\u2019s annual \u201cThe Ocho\u201d event, a few of the world\u2019s foremost Excel experts will battle to solve puzzles on the biggest stage in sports.First things first: how in the world do you make Excel a competitive sport?There\u2019s also the Financial Modeling World Cup itself, which has longer tasks that are more narrowly focused on actual financial modeling.\u201cWe have already shot the game,\u201d says Andrew Grigolyunovich, the founder and CEO of the Financial Modeling World Cup, the organization that oversees the event.\u201cWhat would you rather do,\u201d Brown says, \u201cspend 1,000 hours getting good at Call of Duty or 1,000 hours playing Excel logic games?\u201d To him, at least, the answer\u2019s pretty obvious.It\u2019s now being edited down for ESPN consumption, he says, and the whole match will come out on Friday as well.More than 800,000 people have since watched the full 2.5-hour competition on YouTube (ESPN showed a 30-minute edit of the battle), and the folks who started the World Championship say it changed the event\u2019s trajectory forever.Excel is such a versatile piece of software that you don\u2019t need financial expertise to have spreadsheeting expertise\n\n\u201cI hear from people who were just flipping the TV channels,\u201d du Soleil says, \u201cand are like, \u2018Excel is on TV?And they think spreadsheets have everything they need to get there.All three feature in this year\u2019s battle, too, along with five other spreadsheet whizzes.The VLookup Cup!Most points wins.When competitive Excel showed up on the network last year, the sport found a whole new audience.But these 30-minute smackdowns, which the FWMC refers to as \u201cExcel Esports,\u201d are where the really exciting stuff happens.In every case, the contestants have 30 minutes to answer a series of questions worth up to 1,000 points.So many people have at least a passing knowledge of the app that Oz du Soleil, one of the commentators for Excel Esports, says his goal is not to explain how Excel works or convince you that it\u2019s cool but to simply narrate the drama inherent to the contest.Like so many folks in this space, he\u2019s devoted to the idea that the world runs on spreadsheets and that playing games in spreadsheets doesn\u2019t have to be less cool than playing other games.The answer is by turning Excel into the world\u2019s most powerful puzzle-solving system.But being good at Excel is like having the fanciest golf clubs on the course: it definitely helps, but it won\u2019t win you anything by itself.The Ocho is an ESPN event designed to show off otherwise un-televised sports \u2014\u00a0Excel is on the docket alongside \u201c2023 Slippery Stairs,\u201d the \u201cPillow Fight Championship,\u201d and competitions in everything from belt-sanding to sign spinning \u2014\u00a0but it\u2019s still a big deal.But Excel is such a versatile, widely used piece of software that you don\u2019t need financial expertise to have spreadsheeting expertise.The contestants in an event like the Excel World Championship are given what\u2019s called a \u201ccase,\u201d which could be almost anything.Every five minutes, the player with the fewest points will be eliminated until there\u2019s only one Excel-er remaining.Most of the people who compete in Excel Esports and the FMWC do Excel for a living, which makes sense.",

And we cannot do any of that without the entirety of the creative community,\u201d Zaslav said.Discovery expects \u201cseveral 100 million dollars upside\u201d due to the strikes\n\nNotably, the loss in subscribers didn\u2019t seem to affect streaming revenue.Discovery lost 1.8 million subscribers in the three months following the launch of Max.Discovery Plus has remained a standalone $4.99 per month subscription.While the service kept the same $9.99 per month price, it also introduced a new $19.99 per month \u201cUltimate\u201d plan with access to 4K content.It grew to $2.73 billion this quarter, marking a 13 percent increase.Discovery says the strikes will save the company some money, eventually, the company has to earn money, too.CEO David Zaslav had something similar to say, noting that \u201cwhile we have seen some expected subscriber disruption, we have experienced lower than expected churn throughout this process\u201d \u2014 a process that involved asking HBO Max subscribers to download a new Max app to their devices in order to continue using the service.In its earnings report on Thursday, the company reported having 95.8 million global subscribers across all of its services \u2014 down from 97.6 million at the end of the first quarter of this year.",

            "paraphrased_content": "The deployment is a homecoming of sorts, as Waymo chose Austin to conduct some of its first self-driving tests beyond its hometown of Mountain View.There's pressure to move quickly when competitors like Cruise and Aurora are testing in Texas.Waymo wants One to be a commercial hit first, and that means expanding operations as well as securing permission to take paying customers.The company also made history by offering the first completely autonomous ride on public streets in 2015.Austin will represent the fourth city to get Waymo One following Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles.The first phase starts this fall, with completely driverless operations and public rides coming in the months ahead.While rides have typically only been available in limited sections of these cities, Waymo recently doubled its operational area to include larger swaths of the Phoenix area and San Francisco.The firm also briefly mapped New York City, although it hasn't announced plans to offer commercial service in the region.You can join a waitlist today.Other cities and states haven't greenlit self-driving cars, either.The company is expanding its Waymo One ride-hailing service to Austin.The Alphabet-owned brand has been testing its self-driving SUVs in the city since the spring.There are some obstacles to overall growth.The company recently pushed back its autonomous trucking plans to help it concentrate on passenger service.Officials want to stop or slow robotaxi deployments in San Francisco over safety concerns, for instance.Waymo only just reached Los Angeles earlier this year, but that isn't stopping it from expanding further.Vehicles from Waymo and GM's Cruise have blocked traffic, interfered with first responders and otherwise created issues.The coverage will be \"truly useful,\" Waymo claims \u2014 it should cover major stretches of the Texas capital, including the downtown core as well as well-known areas like Barton Hills and Hyde Park.Texas' openness to the technology may help, though, and Waymo notes that Austin's rapidly growing economy (the second-fastest for a major US city) could help its chances.The announcement reflects Waymo's strengthened focus on ride-hailing.",

            "paraphrased_content": "The company has been testing its vehicles on the streets of Austin since March, laying the groundwork for the eventual launch of a commercial ridehailing service.The company also kept an office in the city until November 2019, when it abruptly shut it down.But the company\u2019s history with the city stretches all the way back to October 2015, when Waymo gave a 10-minute ride to a blind man named Steve Mahan in its prototype Firefly vehicle, which lacked a steering wheel and pedals.Some San Francisco residents have protested the expansion of robotaxis in the city, but it\u2019s worth noting that there hasn\u2019t been as much opposition in other cities, like Phoenix.Waymo says its driverless taxis will traverse \u201ca large portion of the city night and day,\u201d covering spots like \u201cthe heart of downtown, Barton Hills, Riverside, East Austin, Hyde Park and more.\u201d The company makes no mention of the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, where the taxi business is typically the most lucrative.The company also noted that \u201cautonomous vehicles help improve road safety,\u201d a claim that sounds true on the surface but is hard to prove.For Waymo, robotaxis are increasingly looking like its only revenue source.Waymo said that it will start accepting passengers in its fully driverless vehicles in the city later this month\n\nSince then, a number of other autonomous vehicle (AV) companies have descended on Austin for testing and validation.Update August 3rd, 9:32AM ET: Updated to clarify that Waymo hasn\u2019t said exactly when it will begin accepting passengers in Austin.There have been a handful of deaths attributable to autonomous and semiautomated vehicles, but AVs haven\u2019t begun to approach the scale of driving that humans do every year.It will be a bit of a homecoming for the Alphabet-owned self-driving company.Waymo has released several datasets that show its vehicles to be adept at avoiding certain collisions.Waymo\u2019s fourth robotaxi city will be Austin, Texas.The company recently paused its autonomous trucking program after previously pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into its development.The headline has been updated as well to reflect this.But humans drive billions of miles every year \u2014 orders of magnitude more real-world driving than the comparatively tiny fleet of AVs on the road today.The state passed numerous laws related to AVs, most recently one that exempts automated vehicles from certain motor vehicle equipment laws and regulations.Texas\u2019 regulatory environment is more permissive than California\u2019s, where the bulk of AV testing takes place.This resulted in 12.9 deaths per 100,000 people and\u00a01.37 deaths per 100 million miles traveled.Texas, in particular, was going to be the focal point of Waymo\u2019s trucking business; the company was testing its self-driving semi trucks along the 240-mile route between Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston.Waymo says its driverless taxis will traverse \u201ca large portion of the city night and day\u201d\n\nAccording to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, there were 39,508 fatal motor vehicle crashes in the US in 2021 in which 42,939 deaths occurred.And the company was building a hub for autonomous trucks on a nine-acre piece of property near Dallas.And while there are an unacceptable number of fatalities every year, humans are actually good drivers \u2014 for the most part.But that doesn\u2019t mean passengers can hail one of the company\u2019s driverless vehicles quite yet; Waymo\u2019s playbook is to start with manual testing, following by supervised testing, fully autonomous driving, and then, eventually, passenger services.Aside from the safety claims, Waymo will also have to work hard to avoid embarrassing incidents like in San Francisco, where its vehicles have been blamed for blocking traffic, impeding public transit, and stumbling into emergencies.Argo AI, which was backed by Ford before shutting down last year, tested its vehicles in Austin for a number of years.And Cruise, Waymo\u2019s primary competitor, has been testing its vehicles with passengers since late last year.Waymo said that it will kick off the process for a commercial robotaxi service in the city later this year.Delivery robots from Refraction AI also can be found wobbling down the streets most days in the Texas capital.",

Kirk is back on board to shadow Una in preparation for his own promotion.Musical lovers will have a greater appetite for enjoying each track on a loop, but as a casual enjoyer of the artform, I\u2019m not sure how many would enter my regular Spotify rotation.Batel has to cancel her holiday with Pike, she\u2019s being sent on a top secret mission which, I\u2019m sure, is our lead in to the finale.It\u2019s hard enough to sing and dance even if you\u2019ve got years of experience behind you, let alone if you\u2019re dropped into the deep end in an acting job.In the last four weeks alone, we\u2019ve had goofy comedy served up back to back with serious meditations on empathy and redemption.But that\u2019s not to shade the names not on that list, especially those who are getting by with the help of autotune.La\u2019an, who has spent more and more time with Kirk, decides to open up a little bit only to find her advances rebuffed.They\u2019re in a universe that follows the rules of a musical, so when emotions are high, people are likely to burst into song.I\u2019ve pointed out, too frequently this year, the confidence Strange New Worlds has in its own execution.Uhura posits that, if they\u2019re in a musical, their behavior might have to follow the tropes of the genre.He responds by singing his own solo in engineering in which he talks about his abandonment of logic and reason for love, a mistake he won\u2019t make again.Spock\u2019s judgment may be clouded but Uhura, whose awareness of musical tropes has been key all episode, spots the solution.That\u2019s bad for La\u2019an, who is struggling to contain her feelings with her alternate-history beau on board, especially since she\u2019s prohibited from talking about it.They\u2019re also, in many cases, a useful narrative crucible, forcing characters to reveal secrets they\u2019d otherwise never let out.Armed with a tricorder, she drags Spock to the bar where he bumps into Chapel, who then dumps him with a full-cast song-and-dance number about the importance of her career.They soon dispatch a cruiser to shut it down, but the Enterprise crew discover that shooting the fissure will release enough energy to wipe out the quadrant.It\u2019s evidence of a show that knows it has the patience from its audience to play around with its formatting.Much as the ending is ostensibly happy, with everyone learning the lesson to be more honest and authentic with each other, there\u2019s trouble on the horizon.In order to pop the uncertainty field, the whole crew needs to do a big full-cast finale, but not before Uhura gets her own solo.Spock\u2019s nursing his grief, and the rest of his supersized emotions, while La\u2019an has to deal with the ramifications of her not-quite-requited love.And that Carol is currently pregnant with Kirk\u2019s child, who we might not get to see again until Kirk looks a lot more like William Shatner.Not because he doesn\u2019t feel similarly, but because he\u2019s in an on-again, off-again relationship with a scientist called Carol.Michael Gibson/Paramount+\nIt\u2019s almost pointless to try and judge a musical episode by the standards of its peers given how different it is from the norm.Michael Gibson/Paramount+\nUhura\u2019s opening narration informs us the Enterprise has discovered a large subspace fissure.As this is happening, Pike and Batel \u2013 who I can\u2019t believe Pike didn\u2019t dump after arresting and prosecuting his first officer \u2013 argue about holiday destinations.Christina Chong, Jess Bush, Rebecca Romijn, Ethan Peck and Celia Rose Gooding all get showpiece numbers and boy, can they all sing.The improbability field starts to expand, encompassing more starships in the area and reaching Klingon territory.But when they start spouting technobabble as lyrics and feeling the urge to dance, we\u2019re straight into an acapella rendition of the theme tune.Demott Downs\u2019 direction blends the closed nature of Strange New Worlds\u2019 standing sets with the necessary scope a musical demands.Now, onward to the finale!Now, it\u2019s Strange New Worlds\u2019 turn to make its characters spontaneously burst into song as it drops \u201cSubspace Rhapsody\u201d as the penultimate episode of its second season.Chapel has received word she\u2019s been accepted for a prestigious fellowship with a high-profile academic.Obviously, much of the dramatic weight of the episode hangs on the shoulders of the cast members who can sing.Not until Pelia suggests they test the system using music, so Uhura fires up Anything Goes and sends it into the ether.We even get a blast of the Original Series\u2019 theme to underpin their victory, while Spock goes off to smooth things over with the Klingons and get over his split with another round of heavy drinking.Pike, too, starts to confess his misgivings about the holiday he and Captain Batel have been planning.The script, credited to Dana Horgan and Bill Wolkoff, efficiently and effectively works in the musical universe concept without a lot of setup.This comes in handy given the number of running storylines in the back of each episode, which get resolved more or less all in one go.At Pike\u2019s urging, Uhura gets on the ship\u2019s PA and inspires the whole crew \u2013 complete with dancing redshirts and balletic starship dances to produce a showstopper climax.Musical episodes serve several purposes: It allows the cast to show off their hidden talents and lets the production crew indulge their latent musical theater nerd.And the songs, from Letters to Cleo\u2019s Kay Hanley and Tom Polce, are perfectly fine.La\u2019an gets a solo about being emotionally shut off from the rest of the crew, followed soon after with a duet with Una talking about why it\u2019s good to open up.This is the first live action Trek of the streaming era to remember the franchise gets better when it allows itself to be goofy.She\u2019ll be away for a while but declines to share her news with Spock after the fraying of their relationship last week.The only surprise is that this is coming so early on its run; this is just the nineteenth episode of the series overall.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Even if Bungie is successful, more cheat developers will appear as it\u2019s an industry making huge sums of money by offering monthly subscriptions to cheats.Activision has been pursuing cheaters for awhile now, after issuing a stern warning a few years ago that \u201ccheaters aren\u2019t welcome.\u201d The Ricochet anti-cheat system arrived in 2021 with a kernel-level driver designed to catch PC cheaters \u2014 developed internally for the\u00a0Call of Duty\u00a0franchise by Activision.This has led to Call of Duty making legit players invisible to cheaters, enabling an automatic god mode to destroy cheaters, and even a crackdown on third-party hardware cheating devices like XIM, Cronus Zen, and ReaSnow S1.Aimbots automatically lock onto opponents\u2019 heads, so cheaters can fire and immediately take you out.The notifications are being added to season five of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\u00a0and\u00a0Warzone 2.0, which kicked off on Wednesday and also includes the ability to equip a dog.It\u2019s the platform that the vast majority of PC games are played on, but its openness allows cheaters to develop workarounds easily.Some game developers are even turning to lawsuits to target the sellers of cheat systems.Wallhacks expose everyone on a map so cheaters can see exactly where you are.There\u2019s still hope that Microsoft might eventually step in to control its Windows environment for PC gaming.Developers are still struggling to kick these types of cheaters out of games.While kernel-level anti-cheat systems are the preferred method for game developers and publishers to monitor PCs, cheat developers can bypass these anti-cheat systems on Intel-based processors by using a specialist hypervisor\u00a0layer that\u2019s usually used for virtual machines to run undetected on systems.There\u2019s nothing worse in an online multiplayer Call of Duty lobby than facing a cheater that ruins the game, but players can now revel in the satisfaction of seeing them booted in real time.It\u2019s the latest shot in an ongoing battle to kick cheaters out of PC games.These hardware devices are becoming increasingly popular as they\u2019re designed to be undetectable and provide mouse and keyboard users with the benefits of aim assist from a controller mixed with the benefits of movement from mouse and keyboard.Ubisoft created its own MouseTrap system for detecting XIM-like devices that spoof controller inputs and has seen a \u201cmajor reduction\u201d in players using them.Epic Games also\u00a0started issuing permanent bans\u00a0to players using Cronus Zen and Cronus Max devices last year, and\u00a0Bungie has now updated\u00a0its Destiny 2\u00a0terms of use to potentially ban players who \u201cabuse these tools specifically to gain an advantage over other players.\u201d\n\nRelatedUbisoft will mess with XIM cheaters in Rainbow Six Siege\u00a0Call of Duty is the latest to detect and ban XIM cheaters Call of Duty anti-cheat system makes legit players invisible to cheaters Bungie is ready to ban XIM, Cronus cheaters from Destiny 2\n\nThe bigger issues are still aimbots and wallhacks, which have surged in popularity in recent years.Some cheat developers even create private undetectable versions of cheats that are sold at a premium to those desperate to have a competitive edge.Microsoft has created a new Pluton security chip that\u2019s designed to protect future Windows PCs with Xbox-like security, but the Windows developer hasn\u2019t announced any plans yet to tie Pluton to an anti-cheat system.Destiny 2 has been plagued by cheaters for years and its Sony-owned developer Bungie has been engaged in legal action for months against the developers and sellers of Destiny 2 cheating software.Ubisoft is also trying to prevent Rainbow Six Siege players from using this third-party hardware, even messing with cheater\u2019s aim and input latency.It\u2019s an ongoing cat-and-mouse game to catch cheaters and the methods that developers use to circumvent anti-cheat systems.Activision\u2019s proprietary Ricochet anti-cheat system will now notify Call of Duty lobbies when a cheater has been removed from a game.",

            "paraphrased_content": "The Sony Xperia 1 V has a 3.5mm headphone jack socket, now a true rarity in all but the cheapest phones.Then Video Pro has an interface based on Sony camcorders, offering much better control over manual focus and manual zoom.Similarly, low-light results, while good, are also a cut below the best from Samsung, Huawei and Google.The latter is described as being more vivid, but there\u2019s no grand shift in saturation to be seen here, and both modes look tasteful.However, any keen photographer may notice the Xperia 1 V has an unfortunate tendency to leave parts of the image overexposed in high contrast scenes at times.Sony has had its own issues with heat in its phones over the years and, unfortunately, we\u2019ve had some of this with the Sony Xperia 1 V, in another sense.These are elements I always pay attention to.Read more about how we testFirst reviewed: July 2023We\u2019re not talking about overheating here, just the phone getting hotter than it should when performing light activities.(Image credit: TechRadar)Good idea?You can see this when you look down at a per-pixel level, but it also even more obvious when shooting images with very high light contrast, causing a slight smearing effect.We still prefer the iPhone as an all-rounder for video capture, though.Huawei P60 Pro\nSony claims a clear victory for software here, as the Huawei P60 Pro continues to lack Google apps.There is another factor to consider, though.We\u2019ll cover the Cinema Pro, Video Pro and Photo Pro apps in the camera section of this review, but Sony\u2019s pitch is clear.Is it better?And 47% with charger two.An hour of streamed video took 6% off the battery, suggesting it\u2019s good for up to around 16.5 hours.Are things looking bad for the Sony Xperia 1 V camera?(Image credit: TechRadar)How are the Sony Xperia 1 V\u2019s photos?Who\u2019s that?But is it dynamic enough to compete with phones like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 Pro Max?There\u2019s more noise, less detail, and a tendency to record more motion-blurred images despite the use of OIS in both the wide and zoom cameras.(Image credit: TechRadar)We like how the Sony Xperia 1 V doesn\u2019t tend to oversaturate greens in the way many phone cameras do.These are expensive phones.We can\u2019t use our usual methods to tell, as Sony has blocked certain apps \u2013\u00a0including 3DMark \u2013 on review devices.Sony Xperia 1 V camera samplesImage 1 of 12A zoom camera alters the foreground\u2019s relationship with the background, often with pleasing results.Our other two lenses are a 12MP ultra-wide and a 48MP (technically 52MP with an effective 48MP area) primary wide camera.The phone's zoom camera is a reminder that prime lenses (that are those with a fixed focal length) are typically much sharper than optical zoom ones like this.The 5.2x mode is lossless in theory, but in reality it looks very soft.Last-generation phones were capable of some amazing benchmark results.However, it is going to appeal to a key kind of tech traditionalist.(Image credit: TechRadar)This is an image shot at 2x zoom, which we don\u2019t actually recommend as it\u2019s fairly easy to let it\u2019s a digitally zoomed picture.This also means your subject is typically much less visible on the screen too, as it will look darker and dimmer than it will in the final picture.At one point during testing I had to trek across the country, from a 7am start to getting home at just before 11pm.The display's refresh rate also peaks at 120Hz.The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is going to do even better at 10x, thanks to its dedicated 10x camera too.(Image credit: TechRadar)A true triple camera array is ideal for holiday shooting, when you can\u2019t always get that close to your subject.Our Sony Xperia 1 V did not include a charger, but we have plenty of compatible 30W-plus chargers about.This handset is a lot like the Xperia 1 IV, but with a new processor and some other tweaks.If you\u2019re not shooting with a tripod, the amount the manual style of control actually adds is limited because you\u2019re dealing with a fixed aperture lens.Top-ups of just a few minutes don\u2019t have a big impact3.5 / 5Buy it if...You want to use wired headphones\nThis is one of the few high-end phones that has a headphone jack socket, making it ideal for the audiophiles out there who still like to use cabled earphones and earbuds.You want a unique camera\nThe Sony Xperia 1 V has a powerful, an unusual, camera array.The prime use case is as an external monitor for one of Sony\u2019s mirrorless cameras.And games run very well on the phone.Software score: 4 / 5Performance score: 4 / 5Sony Xperia 1 V review: cameras (Image credit: TechRadar)Has a multitude of cameras appsGood general image qualityDoesn\u2019t match the best in extreme situationsImpressive-sounding zoom is optically softThe Sony Xperia 1 V has three rear cameras.But it\u2019s not limited to that.And a big part of this approach is keeping a lot of older things the same as they always were.There is a separate section that lets you alter the color temperature.It is only 71mm wide.Despite lots of audio streaming, some YouTube streaming, a bit of tethering to a laptop, and route planning using the phone, the Xperia 1 V still had about 25% charge by the time I got home.Its camera software is also inspired by Sony\u2019s dedicated cameras, offering a completely different feel to most of the best camera phones.In some territories there\u2019s as 512GB version too.However, with a photographer\u2019s eye the Sony can at times look more natural, for the same reason.This can be a fun one to use.(Image credit: TechRadar)The Sony Xperia 1 V has the best chipset you could hope for at the time of its launch, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.However, charging speed is quite poor by 2023 Android standards.Not at all.However, there\u2019s little to offend or annoy here.It has separate 10x and 3x zoom lenses, for unbeatable results when your subject is miles away.It uses a side-mounted fingerprint scanner, not an in-screen one.As usual, Sony uses a SIM tray you can prise out with a fingernail, and on the other side of this tray there\u2019s room for a microSD slot.It\u2019s a phone I've not had to worry about dying early in the day.It\u2019s the kind of issue we don\u2019t typically see in much cheaper mobiles, making it a head-scratcher in a phone this expensive.You want the best camera for night or zoom shots\nDon\u2019t buy into the hype of this phone\u2019s camera too much.It doesn\u2019t drip in that sense of \u201cnewness\u201d that propels a lot of shiny, expensive tech, which may lead you to question if it is really worth the high asking price.However, we\u2019ve had zero obvious performance issues in real-world use.Lens elements visibly move as you move between those two focal lengths.It\u2019s still largely a blast to use in its Basic mode, has a very high hit rate of shots and top-tier image quality.All three of these, and the selfie camera up front, use Sony sensors.This screen has no notch, no punch hole.And, sure, ISO sensitivity, but you should want the lowest ISO you can get away with, given phone camera grain and noise aren\u2019t exactly pretty.Music Pro is a multi-track recorder app, a very stripped-back take on a DAW (digital audio workstation) app like Reason or Logic.However, the zoom is a little soft and it blows highlights a bit too often4 / 5PerformanceWe get the latest, greatest specs here, although there does seem to be quite significant thermal throttling despite efficiency improvements4 / 5BatteryThis phone is a reliable all-day trooper, and that\u2019s the most important takeaway here.Don\u2019t want to do so?We\u2019ve been spoilt by companies like Xiaomi and OnePlus, which offer charging up to a stupendous 150W.That said, this camera still avoids all the issues of the much earlier models in the series.We felt the same about the sensor on the Sony Xperia 1 IV too.This works well enough for gaming but doesn't really have a function anywhere else.Design score: 3.5 / 5Sony Xperia 1 V review: display(Image credit: TechRadar)High-quality, flat 4K OLED display120Hz refresh rateNo notch, but extended screen surroundsThe Sony Xperia 1 V has a 6.5-inch OLED screen that mines the same excesses as the previous models in the series: a very tall shape and ultra-high resolution.The Sony Xperia 1 V has a 12MP selfie camera.This might be where part of the scene is covered by trees, but the rest is bright-but-cloudy sky, for example.The Sony Xperia 1 V just doesn\u2019t try quite as hard as the competition to retain highlights in these high light contrast scenarios.The Sony Xperia 1 V has one.(Image credit: TechRadar)Low-light images are good, but not best-in-class.In Cinema Pro, you lock in your settings before you start shooting, to avoid all that jittering about.It still uses a two-stage shutter button on the side of the Sony Xperia 1 V. You half depress this button to focus, and push all the way down to capture an image.There\u2019s a Basic mode that feels much more like the standard way of shooting with a phone, using the touchscreen.You can expect to pay $1,399/\u00a31,299/ AU$2,099, matching the pricing for the last model.I find this design makes the Xperia 1 V and its predecessors seem a little chunky, relative to their actual specs.One of the clear giveaways you\u2019re an amateur shooting with a phone is the way the exposure and focus switch too rapidly.This is a flagship processor that addresses one of the key issues of the Gen 1 version: throttling.You can, for example, create folders in the app drawer, and choose the order of your apps rather than just arranging them in alphabetical order.Its aluminium mid-frame has a series of embossed lines running along it too.It doesn\u2019t shake things up too much in this series, but as such does feel quite distinct from the competition.Or, well, sharp-ish.They had processing that looked bad up close, with coarse, jagged or strangulated detail.How bright does the screen look while you\u2019re outdoors?Even when placed next to phones with some of the same specs.Probably not.It wants us to consider the Xperia 1 V a professional tool as well as a normal phone.This is a 4K screen, with a 3840 x 1644-pixel count.Of course, it\u2019s all optional and you can just leave the Sony Xperia 1 V to sort out the order too.Sony uses a conventional Android layout, and the standard approach to the drop-down notifications bar.(Image credit: TechRadar)We can\u2019t help but notice the optical zoom\u2019s lens is a bit soft next to the prime lenses seen in the competition.The ultra-wide uses a quality 12MP sensor, one that sports a less zoomed-out field of view than some.It\u2019s a squared off-slab.External Monitor, another app, lets you use the Sony Xperia 1 V as a USB-connected display.There is genuinely more detail there.The real value here is in putting the options that you can\u2019t change after the shoot at your fingertips, and these aren\u2019t always as useful as you might think.While great, the image preview is weak, and the Samsung and Huawei rivals at this price perform better at night and in extreme zoom scenarios.Sony Xperia 1 V review: Also considerThe Sony Xperia 1 V is fairly similar to its predecessor.According to a hardware scraper app, its default render resolution is 2560 x 1096 pixels, but the real-world effect is a complete absence of pixelation, even if you get your eye as close to the screen as you can, it's worth noting that true 4K resolution only kicks in when compatible content is detected.Color and maximum brightness are great, and the OLED panel has effectively perfect contrast by design.There\u2019s very little to get upset about here4 / 5CameraA lighter touch to processing and multiple manual control apps open up unusual possibilities.The phone approach to video is to constantly check if it\u2019s in focus, and exposed correctly.That matters when shooting outdoors on a very bright day.And if you like to think the old ways are the best, you can switch to other Program, and Manual modes, designed to offer a layout comparable to one of Sony\u2019s Alpha-series cameras.Such a zoom has only been seen in a handful of phones since smartphones became a thing.However, this one is ideal for times when you want to manually set, for example, your shutter speed and ISO manually before you hit the shutter button.All of that is gone, and the Sony Xperia 1 V now has a more relaxed approach to detail rendering in most cases than, for example, the Huawei P60 Pro.That selfie cam renders lots more detail in good lighting, and has more powerful dynamic range optimization.Camera score: 4 / 5Sony Xperia 1 V review: battery(Image credit: TechRadar)Poor charging speedGood, reliable one-day-plus battery lifeSupports wireless chargingThe Sony Xperia 1 V has a 5,000mAh battery, just like the Sony Xperia 1 IV.Sony Xperia 1 V: one-minute reviewThe Sony Xperia 1 V is the best Sony phone for 2023.Would we use it for casual video capture?(Image credit: TechRadar)As you can probably tell from a glance, the Sony Xperia 1 V\u2019s display is completely flat.However, much of my observations in this area come from using the Sony as my one and only phone, which is the norm throughout a review period.I also had the chance to test drive the Xperia 1 V\u2019s zoom camera in a truly challenging situation, watching Blur at Wembley Stadium from the cheap seats, right at the back of this 80,000-plus visitor venue.The Sony Xperia 1 V and I have been places, and this also means you tend to get to see what other people feel about its design, how good they think the pictures it takes look.Yes and no.There\u2019s no way to drastically cut down color pop to reserved sRGB levels, but we can\u2019t imagine many doing so these days anyway.This phone may seem slicker to some eyes too, with a more distinctive camera housing and lots of sleek curved glass.Swipe to scroll horizontally Samsung Galaxy S23 UltraApple iPhone 14 ProHuawei P60 ProPrice (at

Xperia 1 V(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)Review test period = 2 weeksTesting included = Everyday use as my main phone, web browsing, GPS navigation, video streaming, gaming, calls, podcast and music playbackTools used = Geekbench 5, Geekbench 6, 3D Mark, multiple power adaptersMy time with the Sony Xperia 1 V coincided with some notable events.Here are some other key models to consider.Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\nThis phone may not have a motorised optical zoom camera but it is still the king of the zoom.No problem.Sony\u2019s value-adding strategy is more about preinstalled apps than anything to do with the interface.The Xperia 1 V can handle submersion in water to a depth of 1.5m.Sony does not offer particularly good charging, though.This is a notably poor scanner, though.It does support 15W wireless charging, though, and reverse wireless charging, which are convenient extras that don't necessarily crop up on every flagship.Battery score: 3.5 / 5Should you buy the Sony Xperia 1 V?Swipe to scroll horizontallySony Xperia 1 V score cardAttributesNotesRatingValueThe Xperia 1 V costs the same amount as its predecessor.After 45 minutes, it had reached 60%.It can reproduce a good amount of detail, and holds up well in poor lighting, even if you don\u2019t use the screen as a fill flash.Sony does not offer loads of ways to customize how the Sony Xperia 1 V screen looks.It\u2019s a pricey phone only suitable for those wiling to spend big3 / 5DesignSony makes subtle changes to its classic \u201cmonolith\u201d design, including some interesting textures and ridges.Instead, the front camera sits in a little blank expanse of bezel above the screen.And even if the Sony Xperia 1 V did have a variable aperture lens \u2013 like on the likes of the Xiaomi 13 Ultra \u2013\u00a0it still would not give you that much additional creative control, thanks to the crop factor of these cameras.The ability to compare one ultra-zoom camera phone to another is a rare privilege.Sony typically manages to keep the color tone and image character between the wide and ultra-wide cameras consistent; largely avoiding the sense you\u2019re slumming it with the ultra-wide, during the day at least.The zoom camera is easily the most catchy-sounding of the three rear sensors, though.So does it get to the old silver standard of 50% in one hour, as Sony claims?However, we did dig out an app called CPU Throttling Test, which shows you how much performance is lost over time.This year, though, we get some new textures.This is another unusual touch in a top-tier phone.It fires off the vibration motor in time with any sound played.Apart from one particularly bad day when the Xperia 1 V seemed to spend almost the entire day borderline hot \u2014\u00a0something definitely was awry there.It has 256GB storage.(Image credit: TechRadar)An extended zoom is always useful when shooting pictures of animals.You can either use the Creator Mode or Standard mode.However, you don\u2019t want that for a pro-looking shoot where ideally you\u2019d have a focus puller and controlled lighting.The Huawei results were significantly sharper, and not just because of more advanced processing.There\u2019s little to criticize here, if also little to significantly separate the Sony Xperia 1 V from its peers, other than one typically quirky Sony trait.The Sony Xperia 1 V\u2019s back is textured glass, with an embossed dot pattern that, well, makes it feel much less like glass.Build quality is otherwise excellent, though.There are no curves here, bar the very slight rounding-off of the corners of the display panel.However, it\u2019s significantly bigger and heavier than the Sony.Apple iPhone 14 Pro\nIf you like the idea of a smaller flagship phone, it\u2019s the iPhone 14 Pro rather than the Pro Max, you need to look at.Performance loss starts at the two-minute mark, and by eight minutes or so the Sony Xperia 1 V is reduced to around 60-65% of its original power.Long-range photos that would once have been total mush will now look sharp.However, the boring stuff matters too.The Sony Xperia 1 V has Gorilla Glass panels on front and back, using second-generation Victus series glass up front, original Victus on the back, and it boasts IP68-certified resistance against dust and water.They do come with a silly extra, though, called dynamic vibration.Can its speakers make a podcast audible while you\u2019re cooking?The minimum recorded over a 15-minute test was 59%, which happened in both runs we tried.A fairly good set of stereo speakers finish off the outer hardware.(Image credit: TechRadar)Here\u2019s a duck, shot with a more extreme zoom setting.Ruggedisation chops are sound, including IP68 water resistance3.5 / 5DisplayThis is one of the highest-res screens you\u2019ll find in a phone.The Sony Xperia 1 V\u2019s preview image is quite poor too.If you bought last year\u2019s model, you should feel pretty good about that.Charging from a completely flat battery, the Sony Xperia 1 V reached 43% charge after 30 minutes with charger one.Color is respectable too, lacking the kind of obvious oversaturation that makes nature scenes look a little unreal.Is the Sony Xperia 1 V much better in this respect?The camera is a bit more forgiving than Sony\u2019s, with fool-proof processing.(Image credit: TechRadar)The Sony Xperia 1 V typically has good color handling.It\u2019s how I used the Sony Xperia 1 V, most of the time.I got to take it across the country, to a wedding in the lake district, for example.As well as an opportunity to take some unusual photos, this sort of trip is great for assessing battery life in a more challenging scenario.Care about selfies?And there are three different apps you can use to capture.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)There\u2019s the normal route, just using the camera app.(Image credit: TechRadar)Extended zoom modes make it much easier to get closer to insects without the risk of getting stung.It\u2019s an unusual and high-end array, the most eye-catching of the three being a 3.5-5.2x 12MP zoom with a true optical zoom lens.This is Sony trying to make the Xperia 1 V stand out from its predecessors, but in that classic low-key Sony way.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: TechRadar)(Image credit: TechRadar)(Image credit: TechRadar)(Image credit: TechRadar)It continues to reject a few newer conventions of flagship phone design too.And while it means this phone doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201cnew\u201d, it is recognizably Sony in a way other manufacturers, other than Apple, can\u2019t quite achieve.This phone also supports, and incudes, an S-Pen stylus.The person who wants a top-tier phone with a headphone jack.The top ones are shutter speed and exposure.Slower, less responsive and less reliable than the norm, it lets the phone down and the reliability (or lack thereof) is inexcusable, even if this phone cost half as much.It\u2019s not ideal, but we saw drops to 46% performance in the Sony Xperia 1 IV.Sony doesn\u2019t approach photography like the other phone makers, in a repeat of what we\u2019ve seen throughout this review.Again, that\u2019s up for debate and not everyone will love how it feels.This does not happen consistently, but we have felt the phone often get warm when streaming audio.The Sony approach makes a lot more sense with video, in the Cinema Pro and Video Pro apps.And if not, to sort that out as soon as possible.There are a few little Sony tweaks, though.However, it doesn\u2019t compare all that well with the selfie camera of the Huawei P60 Pro one modern-day photography champ.But they often weren\u2019t indicative of real-world performance, as you could lose 50% or more power after just a couple of minutes thanks to heat build-up.Cinematography Pro is based on the experience of Sony pro-grade video cameras, and may be slightly intimidating to some because it puts a lot of stuff, and numbers, in front of your eyeballs.And while it is quite tall and boxy, a lot of other phones feel large by comparison.Don't buy it if...You want speedy charging\nIf you like the idea of a phone that charges in minutes, don\u2019t get the Xperia 1 V. We couldn\u2019t even get its 30W charging to reach to the original fast charge standard of 50% in 30 minutes.You want a fast fingerprint sensor\nThe fingerprint sensor is surprisingly tetchy, as we found in last year\u2019s Sony Xperia 1 IV.But if you want to make a short film, you\u2019ll want to use Cinematography Pro, or Video Pro.That part is a little less clear.Colour and contrast are great too, but larger panels make movies and games look better4 / 5SoftwareTasteful, with plenty of vanilla Android showing through Sony\u2019s interface.This changes how \u201cwarm\u201d or \u201ccool\u201d the Sony Xperia 1 V display appears.Display score: 4 / 5Sony Xperia 1 V review: software and performance(Image credit: TechRadar)Has some \u201cpro\u201d style appsGood performance, but some thermal throttlingGets warm when doing very little at timesThe Sony Xperia 1 V runs Android 13 with a light Sony-made interface and a bunch of wallpapers that bring the software that signature Sony look.We\u2019re just not sure it competes particularly at $1,399/\u00a31,299 in all areas.It can move smoothly between 3.5x and 5.2x zoom, using a genuine optical zoom lens; a true rarity in the smartphone space.As with any capable zoom camera, the Xperia 1 V\u2019s is going to seem like a revolution in fun for your mobile photography, if this is to be your first time with a periscope zoom.Skip on a few paragraphs if you just want to know what the photos the Sony Xperia 1 V are like, as we have to touch on Sony\u2019s photography ethos first.A change in setting is going to be at most a switch from a very small aperture to a very, very small one.The phone tended to last around 1.5 days of moderate use during review, and can be relied on for fairly heavy days of use.Still, this is very poor charging speed for an Android this expensive.While the mysterious occasional heating up of this phone is never going to be a good indicator of battery life, I was entirely happy with how long it lasted in the day-to-day.(Image credit: TechRadar)We compared its 10x results to those of the Huawei P60 Pro.What you see in the camera app as you compose your picture doesn\u2019t look all that much like the final image, because it does not properly estimate what effect dynamic range processing will have.However, using the two phones side-by-side we were surprised at how much sharper the Huawei\u2019s zoom camera photos often looked compared to Sony\u2019s.This phone is just 71mm wide and 8.3mm thick, very similar to last year\u2019s Sony Xperia 1 IV.Phone makers tend to try to eliminate as much of this surround as possible, but Sony isn\u2019t like everyone else.A lot of this stuff, bar the occasional notably-overexposed image, only becomes obvious in direct comparison with another top-tier phone.(Image credit: TechRadar)This shot gives you an idea of the quality of the ultra-wide camera, and its lens distortion.(Image credit: TechRadar)You\u2019ll occasionally see some epic lens flare when shooting bright light sources at night, as seen here.As well as a real optical zoom that slides between 3.5x and 5.2x, it has pro-style camera apps inspired by Sony\u2019s dedicated cameras.You don't want something too big\nLike the iPhone 14 Pro, this is a top-spec phone that isn\u2019t a pocket-filler.It\u2019s a great example of how Sony\u2019s approach to phone design is a little different to that of the competition.However, it is less appealing an upgrade than it would be in an iPhone, as the Xperia 1 V has microSD memory card support.Value score: 3 / 5Sony Xperia 1 V review: SpecsImage 1 of 17(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)Swipe to scroll horizontallySony Xperia 1 V specs Header Cell -
