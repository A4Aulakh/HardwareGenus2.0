there's reason for them to coexist on your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.Serial killerChomet knows when to say, \"no.\"Chomet held up the new Galaxy Z Flip 5 and said \"For five years, I wanted this.Many Android partners, like Samsung, produce duplicate core apps for, say, Messaging, Web Browsing, Photos, and Email.Even though Samsung's Galaxy line of smartphones competes with Google's Pixel line,\u00a0the two companies have thousands of employees working together.Plus, as two very large companies, it's fairly easy to keep apart the parts that shouldn't be talking.However, it's an important role.\"Sometimes I'm called the 'serial killer'.There is an abundance of great ideas but \"much more than the customer can understand or marketing can market,\" he said.Chomet focuses on what's meaningful to people, which is easy if you follow what they've been doing.Many of the choices Samsung makes or Chomet guides it to make are based on anonymized customer telemetry, which is gathered through Samsung account holder usage data.My core innovation is mostly killing,\" laughed Chomet.\"Chomet also defended the lack of feature updates, explaining that what Samsugn did do was based on customer requests.\"1There is an abundance of great ideas but \"much more than the customer can understand or marketing can market,\" he said.Samsung now focuses, said Chomet, on assets where they have something customers want.Chomet, who sat down with me at Samsung Unpacked in South Korea, focuses on product design and feature experiences as well as the choice of features, apps, and partnerships that help make them.Chomet helps define products and manage key partnerships like the one with Google.explained Chomet.Sometimes, the innovation is not quite ready or comes slowly.\"However, what Chomet envisioned wasn't a foldable device, it was an ultra-compact, square, single-screen phone.\"We happily compete,\" smiled Chomet, \"We call it co-competition.\"That phase is gone,\" he said, \"Differentiation is not being different, differentiation is being better.\"We pride ourselves on saying, 'I want the best music.'Third, 'Can you improve speed?'\"In the future, we will see more rationalization.\"\"Competition vs. RationalizationPatrick Chomet works closely with design to realize customer desires.(Image credit: Future)Chomet's job involves identifying the right features or partners to bring in, but also what to leave out.\"We need to change what needs to be changed,\" he said.Following an innovation pathChomet, though, wanted to make it clear that the product teams are not simply picking and choosing new directions with each product iteration.\"You're spot on,\" said Chomet, adding, \"Most people, you are right, will be new users so they look at this thing in its own right.which we did with CPU.\"There were also requests around productivity and software, which have seen some usability updates.He pointed to examples like Chrome now being the default browser on US devices, and the integration of RCS in messaging, a charge Chomet personally led.That said, there will still be cases where Samsung and Google both have something.Chomet acknowledges that they didn't do it because it didn't work as a product.I offered Chomet my theory, that the foldable market is so small that, for most people, the category is entirely new.The arc of vertical Samsung product development is long and, it seems, crystal clear.There is for each Samsung product category a mid-to-long-term identity and direction, said Chomet, who outlined the key identities for each of Samsung's current core categories:Galaxy Buds: perfect fit and intelligent audioGalaxy Watch: fashion, health, and sleepGalaxy Z Fold Fold: productivity and big-screen viewingGalaxy Z Flip: fashion and personalization\"We invest in a very clear product direction, so it's not 'sleep this year' and something else next.Second, \u201cCan you make it thinner and lighter?\u201d which we did.(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)But that competition has sometimes led to confusion.So we need to work with Daniel Ek at Spotify,\" said Chomet.Working closely with design and product teams.Chomet said that if you have more Samsung devices, you'll get more out of Bixby and if you have more Google smart devices, the Assistant might be your choice.It's all the stuff that adds up your experience, the customer experience.If there's a single person focused on what it's like to use, say, a new Samsung Galaxy Z fold 5 and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, it's Patrick Chomet, Samsung's VP and Head of Customer Experience.We do not change identity every year, which makes it easier for people to say, 'In which direction should I innovate?'\"Similarly, Samsung account holders are big Samsung Smart Thing users, so there's an investment in that.When not to changeI wondered though how Samsung and Chomet's interpretation of user needs synced with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 and its dearth of changes as compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 4.When the technology is ready, it becomes meaningful,\" said Chomet who held up the Flip 5 again and smiled, \" I feel vindicated, I told you we need a compact device.\"All Samsung Galaxy phones currently ship with both Google Assistant and Bixby.How does allowing those things to continue the relationship and \"co-competition\"?It's the answers to questions about design, function, pre-installed applications, new features, and old ones.\"The feedback from existing Fold users is that there are no issues, an amazing device, we love it, 'please guys keep doing it.'They know, for instance, that Samsung users use Samsung Notes on their Galaxy phones, so Samsung invests in that.Why race ahead of customer needs you don't yet even understand?\"10-to-15 years ago, Android was the core OS for a lot of OEMs, and it's fair to say many OEMs were seeking to reproduce every app to differentiate,\" Chomet told

black with the logo in green, the distinctive style of Razer products.And thanks to the Blade 14 display\u2019s high refresh rate, the gameplay looks and feels buttery smooth, a boon for hardcore and professional gamers.Ventilation isn\u2019t bad for such a relatively thin laptop; even though it does heat up when during an intense gaming session, I\u2019ve never experienced any stuttering, freezing, or slowing down while playing.For instance, playing Cyberpunk 2077 on maxed-out settings gets you close to 60 fps, and I netted similar results for Dirt 5.Titles like Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered and Final Fantasy VII Remake also able performed well, consistently able to reach 70 fps or higher on the highest settings and with both ray-tracing and DLSS 3 enabled.Razer Blade 14 (2023): Price & availability(Image credit: Future)Starting at $2,399 / \u00a32,499 / AU$4,499Available now\u00a0Available in the US, UK, and AustraliaRazer laptops tend to be quite expensive and the Razer Blade 14 (2023) is no exception.However, if you stream movies or play games, that gets cut down to a paltry four hours.And not only are the specs themselves impressive, but the overall performance is too.It\u2019s a well-balanced laptop that, while specializing in gaming, can also dabble in pretty much any other need you have and handle it well.Performance score:\u00a05 / 5Razer Blade 14 (2023): Battery(Image credit: Future)Poor battery lifeCharges quicklyAccording to Razer, the Razer Blade 14 (2023) is supposed to have up to 10 hours of battery life.The former\u2019s keys are large enough to cater to most finger sizes and the latter is responsive with that clicky feedback I enjoy in a touchpad.Due to its GPU and high color gamut, it can also be used for creative and editing projects, and its CPU means that productivity work is a breeze as well.Despite containing such powerful and normally heavy components, it still manages to remain lightweight and thin, a contrast to the much larger laptop models like the 16-inch and 18-inch ones.Razer claimed it could last up to 10-12 hours, and if going by pure productivity work then it gets close to that with eight hours of life.Despite being equipped with an RTX 4070 GPU at best, it\u2019s a mere four pounds and is less than one inch thick.Total War: Warhammer III naturally performed far above that amount in its highest settings.Otherwise, it can\u2019t be configured by the user after purchase.Specs score: 4.5\u00a0/ 5(Image credit: Future)Razer Blade 14 (2023): DesignThin and lightGreat audio systemLimited color choicesRazer is known for having some of the best thin and light laptops on the market.I also have extensive knowledge of testing out general performance such as framerate and graphics.Read more about how we testFirst reviewed July 2023This laptop would primarily be used for gaming, specifically hardcore gaming.Though the volume isn\u2019t as loud as I would like it, the clarity in each musical instrument and audio cue while playing games or streaming is top-notch and more than worth the tradeoff.I also tested out frame rate performance on max settings with a range of high-end PC games like Cyberpunk 2077, Dirt 5, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered, and more.Being able to produce a high-performance laptop with solid benchmark scores while not compromising on the build quality is no mean feat.It\u2019s a little over four pounds with a thickness of less than one inch which, combined with the 14-inch display, makes it easy to carry around in most medium size bags.And other gaming laptops with somewhat similar specs but much larger sizes, like the Lenovo start around the same price range.And thanks to the 14-inch display, it fits into most medium and up-size bags, making it easy to transport while barely feeling the weight.It comes in two colors, black and Mercury, though the Quartz color from the 2022 version is not available.Swipe to scroll

performance that compares to other similar gaming laptops.The only spec that was a bit disappointing is the battery life.Both its keyboard and touchpad are responsive and have a satisfying snap.And while previously released 2023 models have bucked that trend by embracing the desktop replacement format, the Razer Blade 14 (2023) is a return to form.The second one has an RTX 4070 GPU, 32GB of RAM, and comes in the color Mercury.When used for streaming or gaming, that battery life is cut in half to four hours at most, which means you\u2019ll be keeping it plugged in for any intensive usage.It does have the benefit of charging quickly, with it taking only an hour to fully charge the battery.Disappointing as it set the laptop apart from the generic gamer aesthetic, which the other two colors unfortunately follow.Thankfully this laptop is available in the UK and Australia, which means no import fees or much higher shipping costs.Price score: 4\u00a0/ 5Razer Blade 14 (2023): Specs(Image credit: Future)The Razer Blade 14 (2023) comes in two configurations, the base version is equipped with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and comes in black.Its gaming performance is excellent but suffers from a stuttering issue when doing any non-gaming tasks.Despite it being a 14-inch laptop, it commands a starting price point of $2,399 / \u00a32,499.99 / 4,499 which only increases as the GPU improves.It also performs well for those needing a creative or editing machine, as it netted pretty solid 25GB File Copy, Handbrake, and CrossMark scores, not to mention the 100% DCI-P3 color gamut.This is especially impressive considering that the test units of the other two laptops are more powerful than the Razer Blade 14, and yet the latter can nearly match scores.The keyboard also has customizable RGB lighting It also sports a solid port selection including two USB Type-A ports, two USB Type-C ports, an HDMI port, a power port, a Kensington lock, and an audio jack, though unfortunately there\u2019s no SD card slot or ethernet port.There\u2019s also a white version called Mercury, but unfortunately no Quartz from the 2022 model.It\u2019s able to keep pace with machines with better specs in benchmark tests.It also has a great port selection and lovely display, though the audio is low volume and it suffers from overheating issues.And for general performance, its framerate either keeps up with or passes other laptops with better specs.Razer Blade 14 (2023): Two-minute reviewThis year\u2019s Razer Blade 14 refresh has been outfitted with the latest specs, including the AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS CPU, which sports a 5.2 GHz max clock speed and eight cores/16 threads, and up to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU.In terms of gaming performance, despite the difference in specs, it seems that the Blade 14\u2019s CPU and GPU work much better in tandem, as frame rates usually match and in the case of Cyberpunk 2077, actually surpass the other laptops in high settings.Even better is that it has a physical webcam privacy shutter with a mechanical switch, an incredibly rare feature that\u2019s more than welcome on the Blade 14.Out of all the laptops that Razer released this generation, this is the most impressive one to me.I\u2019ve tested out many laptops, especially gaming ones, which gives me plenty of experience with properly benchmarking them.Ventilation isn\u2019t too shabby either, as even when it does heat up, the performance never suffers.When it comes to other performance metrics, like framerate, it also delivers great results.",

machine through a discussion on YouTube personality Nikocado Avocado's rise to internet stardom.If you\u2019re trying to purchase followers, Twitter will charge you between $2 and $4 to acquire a new

economics can also make sense \u2014 if a company knows enough about its consumers\u2019 and employees\u2019 moral affiliations \u2014 it can make sure to pick a cause-sector that\u2019s in line with

respond to the types of positive signals we receive from those who observe us.He found a large audience with this new format.In Outrage Machine, writer and technologist Tobias Rose-Stockwell, walks readers through the inner workings of these modern technologies, illustrating how they're designed to capture and keep our attention, regardless of what they have to do in order to do it.When we are playing basketball, and you block my pass, I do not take this to be a sign of your long-term hostility towards me.The metrics (likes, followers, shares, and comments) available to us now on social media allow for us to measure that feedback far more precisely than we previously could, leading to us internalizing what is \u201cgood\u201d behavior.Depending on the size of your following in Instagram, for instance, these payouts can range from $75 per post (to an account with two thousand followers), up to hundreds of thousands of dollars per post (for accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers).They are transferable into economic value that is quantifiable and very real.We don\u2019t just capture an audience \u2014 we are also captured by their feedback.Sometimes, even just the latter.Many major brands do this with tremendous success \u2014 creating viral campaigns that utilize moral righteousness and outrage to gain traction and attention among core consumers who have a similar moral disposition.But as nefarious as this sounds, moralization of content is not always the result of callous manipulation and greed.Nicholas Perry became the personality Nikocado \u2014 an obese parody of himself, ballooning to more than four hundred pounds, voraciously consuming anything his audience asked him to eat.With social media we never exit the game.After several years of following his audience\u2019s continued requests, he amassed millions of followers, and over a billion total views.Moreover, it might actually improve the perception and brand affinity by appealing to the moral foundations of the brand\u2019s consumers and employees, increasing sales and burnishing their reputation.But in the process, his online identity and physical character changed dramatically as well.And since the goal of the game designers of social media is to keep us there as long as possible, it\u2019s an active competition with real life.It\u2019s no secret that the ability to consistently capture attention is an asset that brands will pay for.Between 2017 and 2021, the average cost for reaching a thousand Twitter users (the metric advertisers use is CPM, or cost per mille) was between $5 and $7.Following his audience\u2019s desires caused him to pursue increasingly extreme feats at the expense of his mental and physical health.When many people we care about tell us what we should be doing, we listen.If you buy something through one of these links, we may earn an affiliate commission.These campaigns also often get a secondary boost due to the proliferation of pile- ons and think pieces discussing these ad spots.Any strategies that increase how much your content is shared also have a financial value.When the article took off, I shifted my focus away from the consulting work I had been doing for years, and began focusing instead on writing full time.Metrics are Money\nWhile we are paid in the small rushes of dopamine that come from accumulating abstract numbers, metrics also translate into hard cash.When we are playing at having an insult contest, we don\u2019t take each other\u2019s speech to be indicative of our actual attitudes or beliefs about the world.\u201d Games happen in what the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga famously called \u201cthe magic circle\u201d\u2014 where the players take on alternate roles, and our actions take on alternate meanings.If outraged posts have an advantage in this competition, they are literally worth more money.Unfortunately for the future prospects of our civilization, modern social media has focused upon those same character foibles and optimized them at a global scale, sacrifices at the altar of audience growth and engagement.These followers began demanding more and more extreme feats of food consumption.But while it feels like a game, it is unlike any other game we might play in our spare time.It costs that much to get a thousand eyeballs on your post.In the wake of that year\u2019s presidential election, the article went hugely viral, and was shared with several million people.Acquiring these metrics don\u2019t just provide us with hits of emotional validation.In doing so, social media has colonized our world with its game mechanics.But it also has a dark side.With a constant type of habituated attention being pulled into the metrics, we never leave these digital spaces.Do more of it.Social metrics do something else that influences our behavior in pernicious ways.When we open our apps and craft a post, the way we look to score points in the form of likes and followers distinctly resembles a strange new playful competition.Before long, in an attempt to appease his increasingly demanding audience, he was posting videos of himself eating whole fast-food menus in a single sitting.This need not only apply to influencers.In terms of metrics, this new format was overwhelmingly successful.If reality television has taught us anything, it's there's not much people won't do if offered enough money and attention.A follower is a tangible, monetizable asset worth money.This is often a wonderful thing, provoking us to produce more useful and interesting works.This basic economic incentive can help to explain how and why so many brands have begun to link themselves with online cause-related issues.If you have a significant enough following, brands will pay you to post sponsored items on their behalf.In doing this they exaggerate the more idiosyncratic facets of their personalities, becoming crude caricatures of themselves.This is the result of \u201caudience capture\u201d: how we influence, and are influenced by those who observe us.A sizable new audience of strangers had given me a clear message: This was important.Our phones are always with us.When influencers are analyzing audience feedback, they often find that their more outlandish behavior receives the most attention and approval, which leads them to recalibrate their personalities according to far more extreme social cues than those they\u2019d receive in real life.All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.While it may make strong moral sense to those decision-makers, it can make clear economic sense to the company as a whole as well.Let\u2019s now bring this economic incentive back to Billy Brady\u2019s accounting of the engagement value of moral outrage.We are signal-processing machines.We don\u2019t extricate ourselves from the mechanics.For a brand or an individual, if you want to increase the value of a post, then including moral outrage, or linking to a larger movement that signals its moral conviction, might increase the reach of that content by at least that much.Audience Capture\nIn the latter days of 2016, I wrote an article about how social media was diminishing our capacity for empathy.Since moral content is a reliable tool for capturing attention, it can also be used for psychographic profiling for future marketing opportunities.Copyright \u00a9 2023 by Tobias Rose-Stockwell.As we find ourselves more and more inside of these online spaces, this influence becomes more pronounced.One of the by-products of that tremendous signal from this new audience is the book you\u2019re reading right now.This can be an inherently polarizing strategy, as a company that picks a cause to support, whose audience is morally diverse, might then alienate a sizable percentage of their customer base who disagree with that cause.As Boghal notes, \u201cWe are all gaining online audiences.\u201d Anytime we post to our followers, we are entering into a process of exchange with our viewers \u2014 one that is beholden to the same extreme engagement problems found everywhere else on social media.",

Carbon is far from the most engaged-sounding turntable around for the price.You\u2019ve heard other turntables at similar money\nThe premium you\u2019re paying for \u2018Works with Sonos\u2019

your Sonos system, but the Pro-Ject E1 BT does feature Bluetooth, so it can wirelessly connect to your Bluetooth headphones or Bluetooth speaker for painless, wire-free listening.Use the app to get the Stream Carbon onto the same network as your Sonos system, and it will integrate itself into the Sonos S2 control app as a source of music.Fitting the dust cover, which sits almost flush to the platter and has a tunnel to accept the tone-arm, undermines the aesthetic somewhat \u2013 but then you didn\u2019t buy a record player in order to look at it, did you?It seems only reasonable to begin by listening to the Stream Carbon as it wirelessly streams to a Sonos Era 300 (and to a Sonos Arc a little later, just for variety\u2019s sake).The wireless connection is made in a trice, and proves flawless throughout my listening period \u2013 no drops, no wobbles.It\u2019s fitted with a straight, carbon-fiber tonearm that\u2019s 225mm long and comes with a very decent Ortofon 2M Red moving

Stream Carbon?Buy it if...You value convenience\nThe Victrola Stream Carbon is the most adaptable turntable around.At no point did it threaten to give up its wireless connection, and at no point did I find its sound compelled me to just put on record after record.So once it was positioned on the top of my equipment rack, I connected it to my stereo system and listened to it via its phono stage.The distance between \u2018gentle introspection\u2019 and \u2018eye-popping attack\u2019 just isn\u2019t any distance at all where the Stream Carbon is concerned.Just like every Pro-Ject turntable, in fact.Rega Planar 3/Elys 2\n\u2018Just\u2019 a record player, it\u2019s true, but if you want some idea of just how good Victrola Stream Carbon money can sound if you spend it on a turntable that\u2019s designed to do the basics properly, have a listen to this.After that, it works as a volume control.Some record players can do that, but this is not one of them.The top end has a little of that crucial bite and shine, although ultimately treble sounds are rolled off and err on the side of caution.Switch to a hard-wired connection to a stereo system and, in broad terms, the story is the same.Detail levels are acceptably high, even when we\u2019re talking about those fleeting, transient details that are gone almost as soon as they arrive \u2013 the Stream Carbon is beady-eyed in this respect, and lets very little escape.The Victrola has Wi-Fi built in, too, and it has a control app.But bass sounds are quite rapid and reasonably well controlled, so this chunkiness is not at the expense of momentum or rhythmic expression.And, up to this point, far from extraordinary, but all very welcome.On the rear of the chassis, alongside an input for power, there is a pair of stereo RCA outputs.The soundstage it creates is reasonably spacious and well-defined, so the midrange projects well and allows a vocalist to express themselves to the full.It has quite neutral and natural tonality throughout the frequency range, which helps the consistency of its presentation no end.(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)It serves up a hefty, weighty sound with considerable low-frequency presence.And even though it\u2019s around half the price of the Victrola Stream Carbon, it sounds upfront, energetic and enjoyable.You\u2019re a Sonos believer\nIntegration of the Stream Carbon into your Sonos system is simple and reliable.You like nice things\nTactile materials, thoughtful design and impressive finish are all yours here.It sounds completely matter-of-fact, unwilling or unable to deviate from a set level of intensity no matter if the music demands it or not.But, of course, those brands are \u2018only\u2019 selling you a classic wired record player, whereas Victrola is throwing in some very unlikely functionality for the money, in the form of wireless Sonos connectivity.The Stream Carbon is a belt-drive turntable that can handle 33.3 and 45rpm speeds \u2013 speed-change is automatic, via a little button on its plinth.And then I listened to it on a speaker in the kitchen, and then on a soundbar in the living room.(Image credit: Future)At the front of the chassis there\u2019s a big control dial with an illuminated section, the colour of which indicates a) power on, b) pairing to a Sonos system is available, and c) pairing is complete.The Stream Carbon features an \u2018always on\u2019 phono stage, which means it can be connected to pretty much any system or wireless speaker you fancy.The integration of the frequency range is smooth and, yes, consistent, and the Stream Carbon describes rhythms with square-edged precision.Where the Victrola comes up short is when it comes to dynamics, intensity and any sense of engagement with the music it\u2019s playing.(Image credit: Future)Victrola Stream Carbon review: Price & release dateThe Victrola Stream Carbon was released in October 2022, and in the United Kingdom it\u2019s priced at a chunky \u00a3899.The way the platter is sunk into the top of the chassis makes for a very clean, quite sophisticated look.And there\u2019s also an Ethernet socket, which it\u2019s safe to say is quite a rare feature on a record player.Well, not quite.And it\u2019s exactly the sort of product you\u2019d like to think a company that\u2019s fast closing in on its 100th birthday (as America\u2019s Victrola is) might come up with: rooted in heritage and experience, but forward-looking and innovative at the same time.Priced at $799 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,199, the Stream Carbon goes up against some of the best turntables on the planet, from some of the most dependable and high-achieving brands.It\u2019s an altogether more acceptable $799 in the United States, while in Australia it sells for AU$1,199.This, it hardly needs overstating, is Proper Turntable money \u2013 many credible brands have a record player to sell you at this kind of asking price.Certainly the Victrola Stream Carbon has one or two points of difference.First reviewed: February 2023There\u2019s next-to-no animation to the sound of the Victrola, and consequently no sense of engagement with the music it\u2019s playing \u2013 \u2018tedious\u2019 is perhaps only slightly too strong a way of describing it.The Victrola Stream Carbon comes an nice Ortofon cartridge ready to go out of the box \u2013 just what the Sonos user wants.Rega has a global reputation for a reason.How I tested the Victrola Stream CarbonTested for over a weekUsed in a listening room, on a dedicated supportWireless stream to Sonos Arc and Sonos Era 300, hard-wired to a reference stereo systemThe real beauty of the Victrola Stream Carbon, of course, is that you can hear it all over your Sonos-equipped home without having to make much effort at all.And with a selection of vinyl ranging from an elderly copy of David Bowie\u2019s Pin Ups to a fresh 180g reissue of The Cinematic Orchestra\u2019s Every Day playing, the Victrola proves a remarkably consistent listen.Here's the Victrola Stream Carbon with a pair of Sonos Fives.Significant low-end presence, impressive detail retrieval, treble sounds that are definitely on the safe side, and a midrange that communicates well.Record players \u2013 they\u2019re all the same, right?",

            "paraphrased_content": "A score of 171 was really great for me; however, I didn\u2019t want my pride to get the better of me, so I decided to put in an hour or two of practice to get a better feel for how balls with different stats play, while also hunting for hidden balls in each of the game's levels.Well, this is the quirk of bowling I had on my side; if you get a strike in frame 10, you get two more throws, allowing you to achieve that precious 30 in every frame.(Image credit: ForeVR Games)Round one recap\u00a0I\u2019ve already covered my first-round match against UploadVR\u2019s Henry Stockdale here on TechRadar, but in case you\u2019re new, I\u2019ll give you a quick recap.The match started off slow, the first few frames went by with Henry picking up an early lead.I had won and become a VR bowling champion.Want to find out about some of the other VR antics I\u2019ve gotten up to?Skeeva came over, we high-fived, thanked each other for a great match, fist-bumped our host Tori, and then all went our separate ways.Just think of my happy place, the trendy VR Brooklyn bowling alley plastered in dog and cat pics (Image credit: ForeVR Games / Hamish Hector)Eight.Riddled was so far ahead; and perhaps I\u2019d have more fun trying to mimic one of Josh\u2019s trick shots \u2013 I had six more tries to get a strike from across the room, and that goal seemed easier to achieve than victory.I finished the match exactly how Riddled had started it, with a hambone and ahead, scoring 234 to my rival\u2019s 213.A close call\u00a0The semi-finals match would be my closest yet, and the first game in which it was my turn to bowl first.Josh wasn\u2019t part of the competition; he was just there to make sure we didn\u2019t cheat, answer any questions we had, and generally bring good vibes.VR bowling is a lot like regular bowling, but instead of heading to a real-world alley and slipping on some bowling shoes, I simply head to my living room and slip on my Meta Quest Pro.As I've mentioned already, the battleground for the tournament was ForeVR Bowl \u2013 a bowling simulator with an incredible amount of depth.And if playing in a traditional bowling alley isn\u2019t your thing, with ForeVR Bowl you can play underwater, in space, or in a trendy Brooklyn bar.And as the headline gave away, I took home the grand prize, with my winnings going to Crisis \u2013 a UK homelessness charity.Here\u2019s the story of how I became a VR bowling champion.What is VR bowling?We clapped whenever the other player took their turn, and celebrated with cheers and in-game finger gun pew-pews whenever they got a spare or a strike.Skeeva had finished with 147, and with my score already at 144, I just had to knock down four pins to claim victory.I got nine then whiffed my second throw sending it into the gutter.With every throw, I\u2019d leave a few pins standing while he\u2019d score a couple of spares and a strike.Given my bowling past, I assumed this was how things would proceed; I\u2019d put up a good fight, but Henry would edge me out every frame and secure a victory.The physics has been fine-tuned to match real life as closely as possible \u2013 and I was told by a member of the ForeVR Games team that some pro bowlers actually used ForeVR Bowl to practice during the height of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.Admittedly, this depth was initially a little off-putting to a novice such as myself, but ForeVR Bowl is just as friendly a pick for casual players who are after something more akin to Wii Sports bowling.He, too, seemed to share my relaxed vibe, and while I wouldn\u2019t say any of my matches felt super competitive, this was definitely the least fierce.In just four frames, not only had he demolished my newfound confidence, he\u2019d vaporized every atom of it.Neither would it be fair to the charity I was supporting, so I played on.While my luck didn\u2019t turn quite as dramatically as it did in round one, the gap between Riddled and I did steadily shorten.But his early lead was strong, and going into my tenth frame, I was trailing by about 40 points or so.Trying to score 40 points with one frame sounds impossible \u2013 there are only 10 pins per frame \u2013 but I had a quirk of bowling on my side.You see spares and strikes don\u2019t just earn you 10 points.While bowling first or second doesn\u2019t really matter (there\u2019s no advantage either way), personally, my preference was to know the score I had to beat on stepping up, rather than setting the bar and hoping my fellow competitor failed to cross it.My opponent, Ryan (also known by Bread Warlock online), was a bowling natural, and we traded equal blows every alternate frame.But I can already hear you asking: \u201cIf bowling ends at 10 frames, how do you get 300?\u201d After your ninth frame, you\u2019ll only have one more throw (for a max of 20 in frame 9), and if your tenth throw is a strike then you\u2019ll just walk away with 10, leaving you at 270 (eight frames of 30 plus one of 20 plus one of 10).This final match was only to decide who got to pick, me or my opponent.Speaking of my opponent, it was Skeeva \u2013 a member of the Between Realities VR podcast.As well as unique stats, every ball also sports a unique design, so if the numbers serve only to confuse, you can just pick the balls that look cool.This should have been the game that made my nerves go haywire, but this was the most zen I\u2019d felt yet.Nervously, I watched on as Ryan stepped up to play; I covered my face with my VR hands, I literally couldn\u2019t watch.\u00a0Strike.\u00a0Strike.Since the hosts couldn\u2019t join as spectators, the game forced them to play, although their score didn\u2019t count for the competition.Each month I usually produce a roundup of the VR games and apps I\u2019ve been playing.Suddenly, I was the one getting spares and strikes, and Riddled consistently left pins standing.When I was ready to call it a day, I was happy with my performance, and confident that my second-round match would be less tense than my first.How wrong I was.My confidence Riddled with holes\u00a0My round two opponent was Riddled \u2013 a TikToker who specializes in VR content.Or you can check out our full list of the best VR games to see what other experiences you could explore with one of the best VR headsets.This sudden burst of bowling skill (and a few unlucky throws from Henry) put me ahead, and when the game was all said and done, I had won with 171 points to Henry\u2019s 130.Following my first-round match, I was feeling pretty good about myself and my prospects in the competition.This is the reason the maximum score in bowling isn\u2019t 100, it\u2019s 300 \u2013 for each frame you get a strike (for 10) plus an additional 20 as your next two throws were both also strikes (earning you 30 in total per frame).One of us would score a strike or spare, while the other got eight or nine, then the reverse would happen all the way through the match.I had another burst of luck in my tenth frame, and just as had happened in the quarter finals, I scored three strikes in frame 10.However, for July, I'm unable to present my usual feature as only one VR experience has dominated my time: ForeVR Bowl.I\u2019ve spent the past four weeks competing in a VR bowling tournament against 15 other VR content creators, with all of us fighting it out for a chance to win $1,000 (Around \u00a3780 / AU$1,500) for charity.He started things off by comfortably earning a Hambone \u2013 a bowling term for scoring four strikes in a row.I was losing by a lot, and it didn\u2019t help that I was also trailing behind our host, Josh.)Champion of the VR bowling world\u00a0Going into the finals match I felt oddly calm.(I realized later that my tenth frame performance meant Ryan couldn\u2019t have caught me, even if he matched with three strikes of his own; but in the moment I was so nervous, I didn\u2019t spot this.Perhaps because I felt I\u2019d already accomplished one of my goals \u2013 to come away with a good story.I'd secured this by making the finals; either I\u2019d go away and write this feature about how I became a VR bowling champion, or I\u2019d produce a piece titled \"How I almost won a $1,000 VR bowling tournament\" \u2013 a headline that I think I prefer, since there\u2019s a lot more humor to it.Yes, I did still want to win for my charity, but I was comforted by the fact that win or lose, a good cause would be receiving the prize money.And in my ninth frame I\u2019d got a strike, opening the way for a comeback.With this knowledge in hand, I stepped up to the line, selected my ball, and hit three consecutive strikes.Ryan had missed his final shot and come away with 213 to my 217.Every single bowling ball here (of which there are over 200) comes with unique speed, weight and spin stats, with some having additional abilities that alter how they roll further.As enjoyable as the match was, it turns out that the relaxed setting of the final didn\u2019t help my bowling skills \u2013 which appear to be boosted by stress; it was my worst performance yet.I think I only came out on top because Skeeva had some incredibly unlucky throws in the back half of the game, which meant I had an all-but-guaranteed victory as I went into my tenth frame.And because there was no pressure on him to do well, Josh started showing off with some impressive trick shots, lobbing the ball from across the map \u2013 and still somehow managing to do better than myself, despite his self-imposed handicap.This was Josh's view for the trick shots; I can barely see the pins (Image credit: ForeVR Games / Hamish Hector)I felt truly defeated, and as I went up to take my fifth-frame throws, I thought I might just forfeit.What a lackluster way to round things off, huh?In the fourth frame things turned around, however \u2013 the bowling gods smiled upon me and helped me score my first strike, which I miraculously followed up with two more strikes, followed by a spare in the seventh frame.A spare will net you 10 points plus a bonus based on the score of your next throw, while a strike will get you 10 plus a bonus based on your next two throws.It includes my thoughts on new releases, recent updates to VR favorites, and experiences I hadn\u2019t given the time to before.Check last month's feature about the VR games and apps I played in June 2023.But that wouldn\u2019t be fair to Riddled; he deserved a proper competitor, not someone who gave up partway through.Five of the unique bowling balls available in ForeVR Bowl.",

            "paraphrased_content": "When it comes to video calls and meetings, having top audio quality is key - after all, what's the point in a meeting if you can't hear what the other participants are saying?The explosion in popularity for the technology has led to a wide number of manufacturers looking to provide the right kind of kit - whether that's basic and easy to use hardware, or something a bit more premium.If you are in the second camp, and prefer a high-end approach, the news that audio icons Bang & Olufsen have released a business headset optimized for the top video conferencing tools is a game-changer.I was lucky enough to try out the Bang & Olufsen Beocom Portal model designed for Microsoft Teams - so how did it stand up to the test?Testing testingFirst off, as you would expect from a B&O product, the Beocom Portal looks beautiful.Our tests found that this was definitely the case, with the Beocom Portal providing an excellent companion to Microsoft Teams calls.This optimizes the sound quality to make sure your audio is clear and crisp, with the built-in microphone helping block out any annoying background noise.Pressing a specially-labelled button on the left earpiece puts the Beocom Portal into Microsoft Teams mode.(Image credit: Future)Then it was time to fire up the real USP.The audio experience was fantastic, with clear, crisp treble and deep warming bass.Audio from other participants came in loud and clear, and we were able to focus on the call even with background noises such as construction work, washing machine cycles, and even a rather vocal dog wondering what the postman was delivering today.However, we did run into some serious issues when using the Beocom Portal for other video conferencing platforms.Smartly packaged, the headset feels light but solid when first put on, with a range of adjustment options to get that comfortable fit - although our experience did feel a little tight at times.The headset connected to our work laptop using a USB dongle, (with the option of a standalone app for mobile devices) but set-up was incredibly straightforward, and we were underway quickly.Given B&O's heritage, we initially tried out the Beocom Portal with some of our favorite tunes to work too - as we had been told by the company that the aim for this headset was for users to go straight from a business call or meeting to listening to music.Attempting a Google Meet or Zoom call often resulted in unexpected audio drop-outs, as participants claimed to be unable to hear us properly, meaning that on several occasions we had to ditch the Beocom Portal for our trusty Logitech arm mic and headset.We do realize that this version of the Beocom Portal we worked with is optimized for Microsoft Teams, but as many of us do have to juggle multiple communications platforms on a daily basis at work, the issues were troubling - especially as the headset costs around \u00a3349.Overall though, if you're looking for a top-quality audio experience that lets you jump seamlessly from Microsoft Teams call back to listening to your radio or music hits, the Beocom Portal is a must-have.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Emma's Trustpilot rating has been creeping downwards over the past few months due to an influx of 1-star reviews over slow delivery and lack of communication from customer services; I contacted Emma about this a couple of months ago and was informed that this was due to a technical error with its warehouse systems, and that it had been resolved.However I'm still seeing a number of fresh 1- and 2-star reviews, mostly regarding slow delivery and lack of communication, and Emma's overall Trustpilot score is now 3.8 (for comparison it was 4.0 when we reviewed the Emma Premium back in January).At 25 inches the wine glass barely moved; at 10 inches it wobbled noticeably, and at 4 inches it pitched straight over.I've been using the mattress with a mattress protector and Egyptian cotton sheets, and with a year-round 10.5 tog duvet.As well as sleeping on the Emma NextGen Premium in all the popular positions, I've also subjected it to TechRadar's standard mattress tests to get a measure of its comfort, motion isolation and edge support.(Image credit: Future)Hybrid and sprung mattresses tend to be a bit more bouncy and responsive than all-foam models, which means that they often don't deliver as well when it comes to motion isolation, and while the top memory foam layer in the NextGen Premium brings with it some sink-in comfort, it's not enough to completely deaden motion transfer.Beneath that is a layer of Point Elastic Airgocell foam for breathability and temperature regulation, followed by a heavier support foam that further enhances spinal alignment and reduces pressure points.It's definitely less firm than our previous mattress, but just a little more softness wouldn't go amiss for either of us.Read our DreamCloud Luxury Hybrid mattress reviewOtty Original Hybrid mattress\nThere's not very much to choose between the Emma NextGen Premium and the Otty Original Hybrid; they're both rated medium-firm but feel a little firmer than that, they're both a bit lacking in edge support, and they'll cost you similar amounts when they're discounted (although right now the Emma's slightly cheaper).It's essentially a deep layer of pocket springs held in check by a foam section, and it works.Right now the Emma NextGen Premium mattress sits in the middle of the Emma range in terms of price; the Emma Original is the cheapest, with RRPs starting at \u00a3311, while at the premium end of the range you'll find the Emma Luxe Cooling mattress from \u00a31,198.The NextGen Premium is closer in price to the Luxe Cooling mattress than to the Original; here are the RRPs for each size, along with the discounted prices that you'll often pay:Single: RRP \u00a3659 (often sells for \u00a3395.40)Small double: RRP \u00a3799 (often sells for \u00a3479.40)Double: RRP \u00a3959 (often sells for \u00a3575.40)King: RRP \u00a31,119 (often sells for \u00a3671.40)Super king: RRP \u00a31,249 (often sells for \u00a3749.40)At the time of writing there's a 40% discount available on the Emma NextGen Premium in the Emma mattress sales, and while I feel that at RRP this mattress is overpriced, with the discount it's a much more attractive prospect.It's undeniably soft but the material doesn't seem all that tough to me.I am, however, a total combination sleeper who switches between back, stomach and side sleeping throughout the night, and I generally end up sleeping on my side, and fortunately there's just enough sink in the NextGen Premium to cushion my undeniably skinny frame in that position.I was honestly surprised by the size of the box that was deposited on my doorstep as it seemed far too small to contain a double mattress, but that made it a lot easier to manoeuvre into my bedroom.With three thin layers of foam sitting on top of tall 18cm pocket springs, it appears to have more in common with traditional pocket sprung mattresses than with other hybrid beds that you'd find in our best mattress guide.The advantage to having such a deep spring layer is that it facilitates airflow and helps the NextGen Premium regulate temperature, and unlike many hybrids it doesn't feature foam side supports around the springs, again helping with airflow but, I discovered, resulting in less edge support than I'd have liked.Emma rates the NextGen Premium as a 6.5/10 medium firm; having slept on it for the past month, I'd suggest that this is understating its firmness a bit.I'm 6'3\" and weigh around 10.5 stone, and while for much of my life I've preferred a firmer mattress, as I get older I find myself appreciative of a little more cushioning for my tired joints.And if you can hang on until the next big sales event (which will likely be Black Friday), you may find the NextGen Premium at a deeper discount.Emma doesn't include any extras such as mattress protectors or bedding with your mattress, however you'll get free delivery and returns, plus a 200-night trial period and 10-year guarantee.Emma NextGen Premium mattress review: specsSwipe to scroll horizontallyPrice (double size)RRP \u00a3959 (\u00a3575.40 on offer)FirmnessMedium firm 6.5/10MaterialsPolyester cover, foam, pocket springsDepth25cmSizesSingle, Small Double, Double, King, Super KingDeliveryFree delivery in 1-2 weeksTrial period200 nightsGuarantee10 yearsEmma NextGen Premium mattress review: materials and design25cm deep, five-layer hybrid designFour layers of foam including Halo memory foam18cm pocket springs arranged in seven support zonesThe Emma NextGen Premium mattress features a five-layer design that seems to have been conceived to keep the amount of foam inside to the bare minimum.Both my partner and I agree that we'd prefer it if it were just that little bit softer, but in general it's good for back, front and side sleeping (although lighter side sleepers than me might find it a little too firm for comfort).I like the NextGen Premium's simplicity; this is not a complex mattress and I wouldn't really describe it as next-gen, more old-school.Let's take a closer look.Emma NextGen Premium mattress review: priceEmma's second most expensive mattressDouble is \u00a3959 at RRP but often sells for \u00a3575.40No extras includedEmma's mattress range has been through a bit of a shake-up over the last few months, so I'm never entirely sure what I'm going to find when I visit its site (which, as TechRadar's Sleep Editor, is something I do on a regular basis).That's not the best motion isolation we've seen in our mattress tests, but it's far from the worst.Motion isolation score: 4 out of 5Emma NextGen Premium mattress review: edge supportNot the best edge support, especially on the long edgesNo real danger of rolling off in the night, thoughBy far the weakest element in the makeup of the Emma NextGen Premium is its edge support; indeed it was one of the first things I noticed when I got onto it for the first time.(Image credit: Future)Testing the edge support with the 8kg kettlebell resulted in the kettlebell sinking about 8cm on the long edge of the mattress and at the corners, and about 6.5 cm on the short edge.(Image credit: Future)Having checked the measurements and confirmed that I'd been sent the right mattress, I found the business of setting the Emma NextGen Premium up to be plain sailing pretty much all of the way.That means we have to fall back on TrustPilot, and it's not a pretty sight.My previous mattress was a firm pocket sprung mattress with a memory foam top layer, and the NextGen Premium feels only slightly softer than that; I'd rate it more as a 7 or even a 7.5.Night-time temperatures have varied between well below and well above the seasonal average during this time, so I've been able to get a good all-round impression of the mattress's performance.It might have been structurally ready to sleep on, but despite the low volume of foam there was a distinct off-gassing smell that I wanted to give time to dissipate; not overpowering but quite definitely there, and it took a good few days for it to fade completely.Setup score: 4.5 out of 5Emma NextGen Premium mattress review: customer reviewsNew product so barely any reviews onlineAverage 3.8/5 Trustpilot score based on over 36,000 reviewsIt's near-impossible to find customer reviews of the Emma NextGen Premium mattress online.(Image credit: Future)There's a final layer of HRX base foam beneath the springs, and the whole mattress is wrapped up in a breathable, moisture-wicking cover; the top cover can be unzipped and machine-washed if you so wish.\u00a3659at Emma UK\u00a3799at Emma UK\u00a3959at Emma UKEmma NextGen Premium mattress: two-minute reviewAnnounced in April 2023 and released not long after, the Emma NextGen Premium mattress is something of a departure for a sleep brand that's made its name selling memory foam and hybrid mattresses.This isn't a mattress that you can perch right on the edge of; rather you need to sit a bit back from the edge in order to feel comfortably supported.If you're worried about the prospect of having to haul a heavy mattress to your bedroom, don't be.(Image credit: Future)This isn't especially surprising; 18cm of the Emma NextGen Premium's 25cm depth is made up of pocket springs, which means much more airflow through the mattress, and it barely gives the other 7cm of foam any chance to absorb heat.I'm sure many people value the ability to unzip the top cover and wash it, and I've no doubt that a heavier material would be harder to wash and a lot harder to put back in place afterwards, but personally I'd much prefer a more heavyweight and resilient non-removable cover that does a better job of holding everything together.Design score: 4 out of 5Emma NextGen Premium mattress review: comfortMedium-firm feel that's suitable for all sleep stylesZoned support keeps everything cushioned and alignedMemory foam layer provides a little sink-in comfortThe Emma NextGen Premium is rated a 6.5 medium-firm feel by Emma, and both my partner I expected it to feel just a little bit softer than it turned out to be.Reduced by 40% in the Emma sale though, which it often is, it feels like much better value.Because the top cover's removable and washable it feels just a little flimsy; I think the whole mattress would feel a lot more solid if it was stitched closed.Although the NextGen Premium has a premium RRP, it feels more mid-range to me and I'd be disappointed if I bought it at full price.Emma doesn't provide a cutting tool to open up the vacuum packing, but it wasn't hard to find something suitably sharp, and after making one small cut in the plastic an ominous hissing told me that we were in business.The Emma NextGen Premium decompressed to full size a lot faster than I'd anticipated; it seemed like it inflated within a few seconds (again, this is an area in which the large springs-to-foam ratio really helped).Mattress sales\u00a0are a constant thing at Emma, but the brand switches up which mattresses are included in its sales on a regular basis; when it's reduced (which it is at the time of writing), the NextGen Premium can be had in a double size for \u00a3575.40, which to me feels like a much more realistic price.I've been sleeping on the Emma NextGen Premium mattress for the past month, along with my partner, and we've found it to be good in terms of comfort, support and motion isolation, excellent when it comes to temperature regulation, and decidedly lacking in edge support.There are none on Emma's own site; in fact the closest you'll find to reviews on the Emma site are some customer quotes without much in the way of context, so they're no help at all.The NextGen Premium mattress is only sold through Emma, so there's no way of getting customer reviews from the likes of Amazon.At that price, however, there's some strong competition about, so unless you've absolutely decided that this is the mattress for you, it'd pay to shop around.Today's best Emma NextGen Premium Mattress deals\u00a3659ViewNextGen Premium Mattress - Single\u00a3799ViewNextGen Premium Mattress - Small Double\u00a3959ViewNextGen Premium Mattress - Double\u00a31,009ViewNextGen Premium Mattress - EU Double\u00a31,119ViewNextGen Premium Mattress - UK King\u00a31,219ViewNextGen Premium Mattress - EU Queen\u00a31,249ViewNextGen Premium Mattress - Super KingWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesEmma NextGen Premium mattress review: Also considerSwipe to scroll horizontally Emma NextGen PremiumSimba HybridDreamCloud Luxury HybridOtty Original HybridPrice (double size)RRP \u00a3959 (\u00a3575.40 on offer)RRP \u00a31,079 (usually \u00a3647.40)RRP \u00a31,649 (usually \u00a3743)RRP \u00a31,049.99 (usually \u00a3577.49)FirmnessMedium firmMedium firmMediumMedium firmMaterialsPolyester cover, foam, pocket springsRecycled cover, foam, springsMemory foam, coilsFoam, pocket springsDepth25cm25cm29cm25cmSizesSingle, Small Double, Double, King, Super KingSingle, Small Double, Double, King, Super KingSingle, Small Double, Double, King, Super KingSingle, Small Double, Double, King, Super King, EmperorDeliveryFree delivery in 1-2 weeksFree deliveryFree deliveryFree deliveryTrial period200 nights200 nights365 nights100 nightsGuarantee10 years10 yearsForever10 yearsSimba Hybrid mattress\nThe closest alternative to the Emma NextGen Premium is probably the standard Simba Hybrid.And in this respect the Emma NextGen Premium lived up to my expectations.It's not specifically a cooling mattress, however it does feel temperature-neutral.Certainly, within a few minutes it looked ready to sleep on, and while Emma states that it's good to go as soon as it's decompressed, I gave it a good few hours to settle down before putting a mattress protector and bedclothes on it.While the breathable cover and Airgocell foam certainly play their part in the NextGen Premium's temperature regulation, it's clearly the pocket springs that are doing most of the heavy lifting, and the fact that they're not encumbered by airflow-restricting side supports doubtless helps (although that's a mixed blessing).Temperature regulation score: 4.5 out of 5Emma NextGen Premium mattress review: motion isolationA little motion transfer, due to the deep spring layerFoam deadens things slightly, so still a good choice for couplesThe springs in the Emma NextGen Premium are about three times as tall as the three top foam layers combined, and consequently I wasn't expecting the greatest motion isolation from this mattress.It's recently been updated with a sprung base and it also features a layer of microsprings beneath its top layer of Simbatex foam, bringing a similar amount of mix of bounce but maybe not so much body-hug.The foam layers are a little thin (the top memory foam layer is maybe just over 1cm thick), and there's no foam edging to constrain the sprung layers; those springs run right to the edge of the mattress, which I don't think helps when it comes to edge support (I'll return to that later).Read our Otty Original Hybrid mattress reviewHow I tested the Emma NextGen PremiumI've been sleeping on the Emma NextGen Premium, along with my partner, for over a month in mid-summer.Does this mattress really live up to its NextGen and Premium descriptors?It's only been on sale for a couple of months, which means that any reviews at all are hard to find.The cover also features handles on the side, which are a welcome addition and make the business of rotating the mattress a lot more straightforward.Emma's making a big deal about the reduced carbon emissions of this mattress, which is largely down to a serious reduction in the amount of foam you'll find, compared to other models.The box was easy to open and featured a QR code that promised to take me to an easy setup guide; sadly it actually took me to a dead link on Emma's US site, but ultimately I really didn't need it.(Image credit: Future)To put numbers on it, I fetched a wine glass and stood it in the centre of the mattress, then dropped my 8kg kettlebell onto the mattress at distances of 25, 10 and 4 inches from the wine glass.You'll also notice in the accompanying photo that I'm holding the kettlebell steady with my fingertip; that's to stop it from rolling off.Edge support score: 3.5 out of 5Emma NextGen Premium mattress review: setupMattress arrived vacuum-packed, folded and rolled in a boxFree delivery to your doorSlight off-gassing smellEmma provides free delivery to your front door, and for an extra \u00a345 it'll also collect your old mattress on the same day and take it away for recycling.In fact, it kind of feels like an exercise in figuring out how little foam Emma can get away with.While the motion isolation isn't bad in the NextGen Premium, it's not brilliant; neither I nor my partner were disturbed by each other's movements in the night, there was definitely some small awareness of them.(Image credit: Future)Coming to the Emma NextGen Premium from a traditional tufted mattress that featured a spring layer topped with memory foam for comfort, I was surprised and just a little disappointed by how loose and slightly insubstantial the Emma feels by comparison; particularly the top cover.In a month of sleeping on it in the UK summer, including a couple of hot weeks when the temperature rarely dipped below 20\u00baC, the only times I felt myself getting hot in the night was when the ambient temperature simply got too warm; the mattress itself maintained an admirably comfortable temperature.If you visit the Emma site and the NextGen Premium's selling at full price, I'd suggest you wait for a bit as it'll definitely be reduced again within a few weeks.The edge support isn't so bad that either my partner or I have felt in danger of rolling off the edge in the night, but it's less than we'd prefer in an ideal world.And while none of this really says anything about customer experiences with the Emma NextGen Premium, it's something you may want to keep in mind if you're thinking about ordering.Should you buy the Emma NextGen Premium mattress?(Image credit: Future)The Emma NextGen Premium, all told, is quite a comfortable mattress, and it's one that I've slept well on over the past month.I've also found that the zoning in the spring layer means that moving slightly up or down the bed can make a big difference in how well cushioned and supported I feel.However, even though it's quite a responsive mattress, the foam does a pretty good job of absorbing the bounce from the pocket springs.As a result, while there's still a bit of motion transfer going on, it's not really enough to cause a disturbance; you're aware of a partner moving about while you're lying awake in bed, but it's not something that would actually wake you up.DreamCloud Luxury Hybrid mattress\nThe Emma NextGen Premium beats the DreamCloud when it comes to temperature regulation, but for our money DreamCloud has a much more luxurious feel.My subsequent tests confirmed that there's a bit of motion transfer going on, but not really enough to be a deal-breaker.The Emma NextGen Premium comes in at the lower end of the premium price bracket, with a double selling for \u00a3959 at RRP.(Image credit: Future)To get a proper scientific measure of the comfort, I placed an 8kg kettlebell on the Emma NextGen Premium to see how far it sank in.This tallies with my estimation of the NextGen Premium's firmness, and I'd suggest that it should suit most sleeping styles.Comfort score: 4 out of 5Emma NextGen Premium mattress review: temperature regulationTemperature-neutralDeep sprung layer provides plenty of airflowDidn't get hot even during a heatwaveBecause of its spring-heavy construction I wasn't expecting any temperature regulation issues with this mattress.My partner is shorter and more compact, and tends to sink a little deeper into any mattress than I do, but again she's been looking for just a little more sink-in comfort from a mattress.Both of us have been finding our old mattress just a little too firm of late, and the Emma NextGen Premium seemed like the perfect antidote.Most of the inside of the NextGen Premium is taken up by an 18cm layer of pocket springs of varying gauges, arranged into seven zones in order to provide the right level of support for different parts of your body: head, shoulders, chest, lower back, hips, thighs, and feet.The deep layer of springs gives this mattress a good amount of bounce and the zoning does the job pretty well; you definitely feel that the bits of you that need extra cushioning are well looked-after.There are three foam layers on top of the sprung layer.For me, when I'm lying on my back on the NextGen Premium I feel like I'm lying on top of it more than sinking in.In the middle of the mattress the kettlebell sank in by around 5cm, while nearer the edges it sank by about 4cm.The top layer is Emma's Halo memory foam, designed to mould to your body shape and provide sink-in comfort and pressure relief, and to help keep your spine aligned.Despite both being rated the same in terms of firmness, the DreamCloud has more give and support to it, and it's better at edge support too.(Image credit: Future)It was easy to get the rolled (and, I then discovered, folded, which accounted for the box's size) mattress onto my bed and remove the outer plastic wrap.",

Letters can appear more than once.Read on for my Quordle hints to game #552 and the answers to the main game and Daily Sequence.2.Really difficult.What are the Quordle rules?The rules of Quordle are almost identical to those of Wordle.1.And also as with Wordle, the puzzle resets at midnight so you have a fresh challenge each day.You do not have to include correct letters in subsequent guesses and there is no equivalent of Wordle's Hard mode.Quordle today (game #552) - hint #1 - VowelsHow many different vowels are in Quordle today?\u2022 The number of different vowels in Quordle today is 4*.3. Letters that are not in the answer turn gray\u2026\n4.8.7.In the scenario above, CLAMP would be a great guess, as it could point the way to four of the seven words in one go.Oh, and it's difficult.As with Wordle, the answers are the same for every player each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world.So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green.If not, well good luck!Each guess must be a valid word in Quordle's dictionary.* Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too).Yes, he takes it all too seriously.2. Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow.None of Q, Z, X or J appear among today's Quordle answers.Quordle today (game #552) - hint #6 - starting letters (1)Do any of today's Quordle puzzles start with the same letter?\u2022 The number of today's Quordle answers starting with the same letter is 0.If you just want to know the answers at this stage, simply scroll down.10.Answers are never plural.It's played online via the Quordle website and you can also get to it via the Merriam-Webster site, after the dictionary purchased Quordle last year.The first of these should probably be one of the best Wordle starting words, because the same things that make them work well will apply here too.But in Quordle, this will almost certainly result in a failure - you simply don't have enough guesses.There are plenty of other options - you might want to get an M, B, F or G in there instead of the H, maybe - but something like that should do the trick.You have nine guesses to find the Quordle answers.For instance, I currently use STARE > DOILY > PUNCH.That's the case in Wordle too, of course, but it's even more important in Quordle.- and there are daily stats including a streak count.SPOILER WARNING: Information about Quordle today is below, so don't read on if you don't want to know the answers.Your Quordle expertYour Quordle expertMarc McLarenSocial Links NavigationUK Editor in ChiefMarc is TechRadar\u2019s UK Editor in Chief and has been playing Wordle and Quordle for more than a year.1.Plus, it's the only option in Hard mode.In Wordle, you can instead try several of those in succession and hope one is right, assuming you have enough guesses left.But after that, you should select another word or possibly two that use up lots more of the most common consonants and that include any remaining vowels.You get nine guesses, rather than the six for Wordle, but the rules are otherwise very similar.But Quordle is tough, so if you already find yourself searching for Wordle hints, you'll probably need some for this game too.You also get Quordle Achievements - specific badges for winning a game in a certain number of turns, playing lots of times, or guessing particularly hard words.You can't guess ABCDE, for instance.It's time for your daily dose of Quordle hints, plus the answers for both the main game and the Daily Sequence spin off.9.The website also includes a practice mode - which I definitely recommend using before attempting the game proper!I'm a Quordle and Wordle fanatic who's been playing since December 2021, so I can definitely help you solve Quordle today and improve your game for tomorrow.5.",

and VCRs, TV companies started to develop remotes with infrared blasters and advanced circuit boards.And it would work on the next door neighbor\u2019s set, or if you lived in an apartment.Button of the Month is a monthly column that explores the physical pieces of our phones, tablets, and controllers we interact with every day.It\u2019s mostly been a retro-futuristic tchotchke on my shelf, but sometimes I pick it up and play.We had a bunch of radio engineers here, there wouldn\u2019t have been much of a problem, but the radio went through walls.But in the age of Roku, streaming devices have largely stripped the TV remote down to the new essentials: play, home, volume, and voice control.By pressing a button on the remote, you set off a spring-loaded hammer that strikes a solid aluminum rod in the device, which then rings out at an ultrasonic frequency.If you\u2019ve ever heard someone refer to a TV remote as a \u201cclicker,\u201d it\u2019s because of Robert Adler\u2019s 1956 creation.Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nI found my Space Command, the 1970s model one you\u2019re seeing in our photos, in a bin of leftover remotes from my father\u2019s TV repair business.Note to future TV manufacturers: consider a blocky device with four strong buttons that won\u2019t fall between the couch cushions.The Space Command is a product of mechanical engineering rather than electrical.Zenith\u2019s mechanical Space Command lived on for a quarter of a century\u00a0as the default way to control a television.The button-pressing experience is slow and literally clunky, but it gives you a feeling of accomplishment, even if it is just to increase the volume on the TV.You can make out the aluminum rods through the grille on one end.Even today, some people still call their remotes \u201cthe clicker.\u201d It did have its flaws: people found that jingling keys or coins could be picked up by the TV\u2019s microphones and accidentally change the channel, and the high-pitch frequencies from the remote were discernible by pets.Though you don\u2019t hear the ultrasonic frequency they emit, you do hear (and feel) the clack of the hammer against the aluminum rods and a simultaneous clink of confirmation when your finger hits the body of the remote.And I came up with ultrasound because I knew that ultrasound in the air would not go through walls, so it was like ordinary speaking\u2026That part was logical.Button of the MonthIn today\u2019s digital age, it sometimes feels like hardware has taken a back seat to the software that drives our devices.So Zenith\u2019s engineers tried an even simpler\u00a0approach that didn\u2019t require batteries at all, using sound instead of light.PreviousNext1/8 Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergePreviousNext1/8 Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nRelatedWhy a toaster from 1949 is still smarter than any sold today\n\nModern universal remotes can be messy and complicated to the point some people started taping over large parts of the device to avoid confusion.This also did not require the remote to be pointed directly at a receiver, which was a major flaw with the Flash-Matic.Advertisement for the original Space Command in the \u201950s.feedback, almost like you\u2019re trying to ignite a flame on an outdoor grill.It had to be ultrasound.It also just so happened to contain one of the most influential and intriguing buttons in history.When Zenith first started experimenting with wireless remote controls, it used beams of light that the television could receive to communicate a command, eventually debuting the Flash-Matic in 1955.It was a trap.We\u2019re back to a minimalist aesthetic for the quintessential coffee table gadget, embodying some (but not all) of the values the early Space Command delivered.We can\u2019t encode the signal because we can\u2019t use 100 vacuum tubes.In 1956, Adler addressed problems we still live with today: I\u2019m constantly swapping out AAA batteries in my home, and I regularly move things out of the way of my Xbox receiver so my infrared remote can reach it.The Zenith Space Command, one of the first wireless television remotes ever to exist, is a monument to a time before we took the remote for granted.Subsonic didn\u2019t make sense from a technical standpoint, so there you are.The buttons stand tall and stiff, so there\u2019s little room for error.I didn\u2019t want it to be heard, so it had to be either subsonic or supersonic.Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nAgain, it required no batteries \u2014 much desired by Zenith, as the company didn\u2019t want customers to think a TV was broken when the battery died.Pressing down a button on this tuning fork contraption gives you beautifully clicky (dare I say chalky?)Each button has a different length rod, thus a different high-frequency tone, which triggers a circuit connected to a microphone in the television to finish the command.We ended up with dozens of squishy buttons placed sporadically over slabs of plastic that are glued together \u2014 mostly an afterthought and often tossed into the junk drawer at home.Now today, of course, you say, well, why don\u2019t you encode the signal?The elegant Star Trek-esque gadget pioneered a durable, clicky action for controlling gadgets and a simplicity of form that has since been naively abandoned.In Adler\u2019s own words, from a 2004 interview with the Television Academy Foundation:\n\nIt was clear to all of us that we couldn\u2019t use radio.It only took a year in the market for this idea to be abandoned due to its sensitivity to full-spectrum light from the sun and lightbulbs.",

            "paraphrased_content": "The Leaf 2 starts at $199, has page turning buttons, the Google Play Store, and a user experience that needs improvement.So why not its e-readers too?While most e-readers are slim, with small bezels and sleek exteriors, the E-Ink part of the Nook line up looks like it stumbled out of 2012.I\u2019m personally enamored with Onyx Boox and its line up of Android E-Ink tablets.It could theoretically do away with a lot of that friction.My first e-reader wasn\u2019t a Kindle, it was a Nook.This leads to a lot of friction that doesn\u2019t exist when you use a traditional tablet or phone.These tablets are getting more popular in non-American markets where one two to companies don\u2019t have a virtual monopoly on the e-reader space.If I press a button to turn the page...I need the page to turn.But at least it\u2019s got the Google Play Store on the home screen so you can choose which e-reader app you use.The Nook Glowlight 4 looks familiar...The flagship is the Nook Glowlight 4 which is a little more expensive than the Kindle and a little cheaper than the Kobo, and few features lighter than both.Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe problem is the software experience isn\u2019t always very good, and most Android applications aren\u2019t built for E-Ink displays with their glacially slow refresh rates.But soon Amazon turned its considerable might, and ability to subsidize its ebook business with all its other more lucrative businesses, against Barnes & Noble, and as it raced Amazon to the cheapest e-reader Barnes & Noble lost whatever identity its e-reader division was developing.When you\u2019re trying to rebrand your company as indie and cool you can\u2019t show up with the Nook.Anti-Amazon customers and Nook diehards who never switched can\u2019t be that much of a market, and it also has to compete with Kobo to woo people opposed to Amazon\u2014which analysts estimate owns between 68 and 83-percent of the ebook marketshare in the U.S.\n\nWith that kind of dominance Barnes & Noble either needs to fight over the scraps with Kobo (which is owned by Rakuten\u2014the massive Japanese online retailer) or differentiate itself.It\u2019s waterproof.Then there are the E-Ink readers.It\u2019s not that first generation Nook from way back in 2009, but it feels more exciting than what Amazon is offering at the same price.Namely the quality kind of sucks.You can\u2019t see it, but this thing has a headphone jack.In September Barnes & Noble is going to try and turn things around with the $199 GlowLight 4 Plus.It wants its brick and mortar stores to express their individualism.The Nook business doesn\u2019t come up in the profile, and thats probably for the best.When Daunt launched the $149 Nook Glowlight 4 in 2021 he said that the company was looking to \u201creinvigorate Nook in the coming months and years.\u201d Since than the company released four ebook-reading devices.For example, you can access library books on the Nook, but keeping with the early 2010 theme of this lineup, you will need a USB cable and Adobe software.It had a 6-inch 167 ppi E-Ink display and a tiny, terrible, but exciting LED display underneath.There is 32GB of onboard storage and a front-lit E-Ink display with 300ppi resolution and color temperature control.The problem is, like the other Nook e-readers its kind of dorky, and if you\u2019re already in the Kindle ecosystem\u2014which a lot of people are\u2014there\u2019s not a super compelling reason to switch over beyond a desire to cut the Amazon cord or because you love buttons.It felt like the perfect bridge device between my smartphone and my computer.Daunt was brought on in 2019 to help save the company that had been devastated by high rents on its stores, a precipitous decline in sales, and the aforementioned retail giant.Lackluster design and physical buttons aren\u2019t gone be enough.Coming out a year before the iPad, it felt electric.It\u2019s got a headphone jack and Bluetooth.Looking at it I feel the urge to ask the Glowlight 4 who the president is.Image by Barnes & Noble\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s supposed to be this way.But it does have page turning buttons!Daunt\u2019s vision for the indie bookstore killer approaches the ironic.The $99 Nook Glowlight 4e has page-turning buttons too, but sacrifices even more than the Glowlight 4 to keep its price low.There was a headphone jack, wi-fi, and a music player built right in.Wall Street Journal has a profile of the company out this week that\u2019s a fascinating look at how Barnes & Noble is learning to compete with Amazon without cannibalizing itself in the process.Meanwhile Overdrive can send books to your Kindle directly, and while it can be difficult to set up, Kobo has Overdrive built in.Kobo is similar.There\u2019s a reason downloading a library books isn\u2019t as seamless as buying a booking from the Kobo store.Amazon will never build a Kindle with that flexibility\u2014it ones you to stay right in the Amazon ecosystem.Imagine an e-reader that supported the Barnes & Noble store out of the box but allowed you to also access your Kindle library, or easily check out a book from Libby, or scroll through your bookmarked articles in Pocket too.It felt like Star Trek.Now, years after Amazon won and Barnes & Noble lost, the company is privately held and it has a new CEO, James Daunt.You can buy one on Amazon or direct from the manufacturer pretty easily.There\u2019s the 10-inch Android tablet made by Lenovo, that...looks like every other $130 tablet.I\u2019d love to see Amazon release an Android E-Ink tablet.But Barnes & Noble is the bookseller that wants to show off its independent spirit.It\u2019s unclear how Daunt\u2019s current \u201creinvigoration\u201d of the Nook brand is going for the company financially, but from the outside I don\u2019t see how it can be doing anything but breaking even.Image by Barnes & Noble\n\nThe Nook lineup includes a couple of other features that should theoretically be compelling, but always come up just short.The once giant of publishing is handing control of its stores to its managers, attempting to instill in each of its stores the independent spirit it used to quash.We had lots of issues with responsiveness which is probably the most frustrating sin an e-reader can commit.But Barnes & Noble has a lovely app experience.",

work, like gold, and prices custom items for customers based on the price of gold that day.\u201cI wake up at 4 in the morning, and I\u2019m sitting in bed thinking about this.\u201d\n\nD., who asked that The Verge not identify them for fear of retaliation, is far from alone.\u201cI pay my rent, I pay my groceries, I live on the money from Etsy.\u201d\n\nThe shift in how they\u2019re paid has been stressful for D. and other sellers who are making custom products that take longer to produce and mail out.But customers might place orders months in advance, and Etsy\u2019s processing time only stretches to up to 10 weeks.After Etsy fees, taxes, and other expenses are pulled from the remaining 25 percent D. has access to, they\u2019re only left with around $13.\u201cShe\u2019s doing what is best for her customers and her business, but in the Etsy system, it\u2019s showing that she has late orders that haven\u2019t been processed,\u201d Lohr says.Subsequent profit from sales first goes toward replenishing the reserve minimum before money is available to be deposited into a seller\u2019s own account.D. says their shop hasn\u2019t had an influx of orders or refunds, and out of hundreds of orders this year, just one was shipped without tracking.Lead time for orders from D.\u2019s shop is about two weeks; in the meantime, they\u2019re forced to dip into savings and credit to fund their business and personal expenses.They\u2019re also declining high-value custom work.Y. says the delay in payments has forced them to reduce restocks, and they\u2019re unable to keep as much inventory.Orders must ship on time, and customer messages must be returned within 24 hours.One way some sellers have been told they can avoid reserves is to meet the Star Seller program requirements, a designation given by Etsy that rewards shops that meet shipping and customer service benchmarks.Though the reserve system might block scammers from running off with customers\u2019 money, it\u2019s created a situation that can quickly spiral for legitimate sellers who don\u2019t have funds stockpiled to cover operating costs.If a seller buys a shipping label, pays for Etsy ads, or otherwise zeroes out the 25 percent portion that\u2019s available to them, the remaining balance is pulled from the 75 percent set aside.\u201cI had to take a personal loan to pay people for the first few weeks, because I had just restocked and it was a complete surprise to suddenly be getting zero dollars from my payment account,\u201d Y. told The Verge via text message.But sellers like D. say Etsy is applying reserves to longtime shops in good standing, and they\u2019ve been unable to get answers from Etsy about why their money is being held.In D.\u2019s case, 75 percent of earnings from a $150 order, as an example, are being held by Etsy \u2014 in what\u2019s known as a \u201cpayment reserve\u201d \u2014 for anywhere between two weeks and 45 days.D. considers themselves lucky \u2014 they can operate a smartphone at lightning speed and quickly communicate with customers.\u201cI pay my rent, I pay my groceries, I live on the money from Etsy.\u201cIn some cases, we will delay a portion of funds from a sale until we can confirm that the order has shipped.D., a carpenter and Etsy seller of several years, recently sold a piece of custom, made-to-order furniture for around $150.\u201cI\u2019m in stress mode right now,\u201d D. says.\u201cI have all those things going for me, and [if] it\u2019s still hard for me, it is just 10 times harder for anybody who can\u2019t navigate these systems successfully.\u201dChiarra Lohr, secretary-treasurer of the Indie Sellers Guild, which represents artisans, including Etsy sellers, says the organization has heard from dozens of longtime sellers who\u2019ve had their accounts placed on reserve in recent months.And in late May, the chorus of questions about payment reserves grew loud enough that Etsy felt compelled to respond publicly, posting a short message about the system.More than $3,000 of D.\u2019s earnings are held in reserve, according to a screenshot they shared \u2014 they have access to about 1 percent of that after fees, taxes, and other costs are deducted.Y., a metalsmith making high-quality custom jewelry, has completed tens of thousands of sales and maintains a high customer rating.(Etsy didn\u2019t respond to specific questions about whether recent reserves are connected to this.)But because my items are made to order, I need the cash flow,\u201d D. says.The unexpected hold on a large portion of their earnings means that their business, ironically, has become less stable than it was.Each time a sale is made, a seller\u2019s reserve minimum \u2014 that 75 percent portion of the sale \u2014 goes up accordingly, creating a running count that a seller must meet.Y. says they\u2019re not upset by the payment reserve system on the marketplace \u2014 the most disruptive part is the way Etsy has designed it.A moderator of the r/EtsySellers subreddit says the group has seen a surge in questions about shops being placed on reserve.They point to the role Etsy has played in providing job flexibility to them and to other disabled artisans and small sellers that increasingly feels distant.Reserves mitigate this problem by keeping customers\u2019 money in Etsy\u2019s hands so that if problems arise, it can be returned quickly.(Y. also requested anonymity, fearing retaliation for speaking out.)According to Etsy\u2019s terms of service, placing accounts on reserve is meant to protect buyers and make sure sellers are able to keep up with the flow of orders \u2014 the idea appears to be that it will push sellers to work through their backlog and ship purchases so that their full funds are released to them.At times, Y.\u2019s orders were late to ship out, and they acknowledge that the payment reserve on their account may be due to that.Since late June, Etsy has had D.\u2019s account under restrictive settings, putting a hold on the bulk of money that\u2019s coming in as customers place orders.An r/EtsySellers moderator told The Verge that they\u2019ve observed that most reserve cases stemmed from orders being shipped without tracking information.D., the custom furniture seller, is desperately trying to hit Star Seller status so that their reserve might be lifted in August.\u201cThere are people out there who are not digital natives, who are not native English speakers, who are older, who are really making a living on this,\u201d D. says.The Indie Sellers Guild recently started a petition imploring Etsy to work with sellers who are affected by reserves.Indie artisans have long complained that it\u2019s becoming harder and harder to support themselves via Etsy sales as the company has relaxed rules around the definition of handmade, increased fees, and pushed sellers to offer services like tracked shipping and around-the-clock customer service.\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly frustrating for both me and my customers who desperately want me to restock stuff,\u201d Y. says.\u201cWhen I ship those orders, I get [that $3,000].Their focus, though, has been on delivering the best to their customers by making custom prototypes and testing products before sending them out.The company says that, on average, funds on reserve are released to sellers within two weeks.But not every person reliant on Etsy is in that position.Another seller, Y., had a payment reserve placed on their account in mid-May without any prior warning.This enables us to continue paying sellers in a timely manner while taking the steps necessary to help keep our marketplace safe and protect our customers when there are unexpected issues with their order,\u201d Patel told The Verge via email.Their earnings would be tied up for weeks while bills, rent, and expenses pile up.They also pointed to buyers being scammed by new shops that pop up, take an order, and delete their storefront.Shops might have a reserve placed on their account if they just started selling on the marketplace, got an influx of orders, or if orders are consistently shipped without tracking.When their account wasn\u2019t under reserve, the roughly five-day difference between when they purchased materials to when the money was transferred to them was manageable; now, that difference can stretch to two weeks or more.The sale itself was business as usual for their shop \u2014 but it came with a sense of exasperation.The system is more complicated than Etsy, holding 75 percent of the total amount a buyer paid.Lohr of the Indie Sellers Guild says the group heard from a baked goods seller, for instance, who ships orders right before a customer\u2019s event.Though reserves are affecting just a fraction of the total sellers on Etsy, those who are subject to the rules can struggle to maintain their business with the delayed cash flow.And so $3,000 that I would have otherwise had here, just five days before rent is due, I don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nMany Etsy sellers live \u201chand to mouth,\u201d as D. puts it \u2014 though they might stock premade products in their shop, they often use money from a sale to purchase materials for that order.Less than 2 percent of shops currently have a payment reserve placed on their accounts, and for most of those shops, the amount being held is less than $50, says Chirag Patel, head of payments at Etsy.",

we\u2019ll need more retro Z glass.If indeed we\u2019re talking Z7 II-like pricing, then throwing in the retro Z 28mm f/2.8 SE full-frame lens that was launched alongside the Z fc would be the cherry on the cake.The latter stacked sensor delivers some serious firepower, offering next-level continuous shooting and video performance, with negligible rolling shutter.It will do what\u2019s so important now \u2013 make for a delightful shooting experience, especially for enthusiast photographers.If I was to hazard a guess, the 45.7MP sensor from the Z7 II will make its way into the Zf, and I predict that Nikon might recycle a lot of Z7 II's tech into the new shell of the Zf.Creating a Z7 II in a new shell will allow Nikon to set the price of the Zf that little bit lower than the $4,000 / \u00a34,000 / AU$7,500 Nikon Z8.(Image credit: Future)Nikon Zf: price and release dateAccording to the rumors, the Zf is the only remaining Nikon mirrorless camera in the 2023 pipeline.Except, being a mirrorless camera, the Zf won\u2019t be as large as the Nikon Df, which is a DSLR with chunkier pentaprism optical viewfinder and greater flange depth (the distance between image sensor and lens mount) that requires the camera to be physically deeper.Most of all, the Zf will look damn good, and will tap into your creativity in a way that a smartphone and even a modern run-of-the-mill mirrorless can\u2019t.I don\u2019t think Nikon can reasonably go much higher than the Nikon Z7 II, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a lot less.Nikon\u2019s \u2018f\u2019 nomenclature was actually first seen a full 10 years ago in 2013, in the Nikon Df DSLR camera, which was a full-frame, weather-sealed, photography-only, design delight.The Z fc, one of the best beginner mirrorless cameras, represented a compelling Fujifilm X-T30 II alternative, and remains competitively priced.But I, like many Nikon fans, was left asking: will there be a more high-end, full-frame version of the 'casual' Z fc, one that truly pays homage to the Nikon FM2 \u2013 the 30-year-old 35mm film camera that the Z fc directly took its design cues from, a camera with legendary ruggedness.If Nikon Rumors is accurate, we\u2019ll see such a camera in 2023, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited for what is likely to be one of this year's best mirrorless cameras.As for pricing, we think the Zf will be pitched at the level of the Nikon Z7 II, which was launched in 2020 with a list price of $3,000 / \u00a33,000 / AU$5,500 body only \u2013 that\u2019s a full 25% less than the Nikon Z8.The Zf will have those tactile exposure dials \u2013 shutter speed, ISO, exposure compensation \u2013 plus a top LCD.But just how much lower can we realistically hope for?A full-frame Nikon Z camera with the same retro design concept as the crop-sensor Nikon Z fc.I\u2019d also love to see more retro Nikon Z lenses that take design cues from the Zf, or of course Nikon\u2019s legacy 35mm lenses.It\u2019s what enabled Nikon to do away with the mechanical shutter in the Z9 altogether.Great as that stacked sensor would be in a rumored Zf, it's a super-expensive component, and feels a bit overkill for a retro snapper that's primarily drawing the attention of photographers.Nikon Zf: Cut to the chaseThe top plate of the Nikon Z fc camera (Image credit: Future)What is it?Unknown, but we predict similar to the Nikon Z7 II, which had a list price of $3,000 / \u00a33,000 / AU$5,500 at launch in 2020.Nikon Zf: design delightDesign will be where the Nikon Zf shines.I think lovers of traditional cameras for photography need a Fujifilm alternative \u2013 and not just the Leica offerings that are unattainable for most people \u2013 and the Nikon Zf could be that very camera.Image 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)It will be an altogether different shooting experience to an awkward smartphone camera.Let\u2019s take a look at what we can expect from the upcoming Nikon Zf.",

            "paraphrased_content": "In Path of Exile, we had one character class for each of the combinations of Strength, Dexterity andIntelligence.Every class has a dodge roll with no cooldowns or limitations of any kind.Moreover, the developers worked hard to improve the feeling of melee combat by adding mobility to the skills.Overall, there's more than 100 of them, each sporting unique mechanics that will have to be learned by players.Over the years in development, the game's scope continued to grow, featuring new monsters, skills, mechanics, classes, and more.We realized that since we had new mechanics for every attribute combination, it actually made sense to design new character classes to explore the new themes.On Dexterity, you have the Ranger and the spear-focused Huntress.That said, microtransactions will be available across both games where applicable.Grinding Gear Games reworked how debuffs work in Path of Exile 2.This will only work with passives granted from Skill Books rather than all passives in a tree, but it'll still increase the number of options available to players when building a character.Diablo IV made a big debut last month, retaking the throne of the hack-and-slash genre.Another major change from the first Path of Exile is that Weapon Swap also includes automatic switching from one build to another of the passive tree, allowing characters to take advantage of each weapon's best features.Killing an optional boss might provide a permanent stat bonus for your character.Share this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n TwitterEach class will also come with its own three Ascendancies, providing further ways to refine and specialize the class uniquely.The developers described Path of Exile 2 as 'huge' and also said they didn't want to mess with the first installment, so they will exist as separate titles.Being a spellcaster with a bear form makes sense for Strength Int, but it really doesn't sound like something a Templar would do.Dodge can even be used to cancel almost any animations whenever needed.In Path of Exile 2, every attribute combination has two classes associated with it.Every area of the Path of Exile 2 campaign contains a challenging boss.There's also a brief window to redirect your attack's direction from one way to another if need be.When looking at the design of Path of Exile 2, we realized that many of the new skills that we were trying to design, didn't really fit thematically with the existing classes that we have.For example, if you unlocked the stash tabs or purchased a particularly cool sword cosmetic item, both will carry over.Related StoryAlessio PalumboEverything You Ever Wanted to Know About Diablo IV Customization / Respec / Progression / Crafting SystemsGrinding Gear Games then described the significant changes made to the class system in the sequel, as outlined below.To begin with, the developer clarified that Path of Exile 2 will be a full sequel instead of being considered a mere standalone campaign as originally announced.Strength/Int has the Templar or the Druid.A new resource called Spirit was added to the game.And on Dex/Int, you have the Shadow and the Monk.All characters have 100 Spirit by default, but the value can be increased with mods and through the passive tree.This dedicated resource is used for Heralds, Auras, Minions, and more.However, Blizzard must keep expanding its game to stay on top, as Grinding Gear isn't pulling any punches with the upcoming Path of Exile 2.You'll still be hit with Area of Effect spells and abilities while dodging, but direct strikes will miss.As promised, Grinding Gear Games delivered a major Path of Exile 2 update at ExileCon 2023, hosted yesterday in Auckland, New Zealand.Crowd control mechanics now have internal meters that slowly build up, allowing developers to avoid the situation of the first game where they had to empower bosses with immunities to effects like freeze.",

has launched a Pro version of its feature-packed watch aimed at lovers of the great outdoors and is likely to fill the void before we see the Fenix 8.For the Fenix 7 Pro, the headline news is that one of the best Garmin watches is seeking to improve things even further in the display and heart rate tracking departments and now wants to help you better understand how well-equipped you are at tackling hills and endurance events.The Fenix 7 was an impressive watch and it\u2019s more of the same with the Pro, offering a rich array of sports profiles, metrics, training and analysis insights and the kind of battery life that can keep you away from a charger for weeks.The problem that the Pro has is that many of the big software features have headed to the older Fenix 7 series, making the Pro version more of a sell for older Fenix owners and those that really want the newest outdoor features that Garmin has to offer.Garmin Fenix 7 Pro: SpecificationsSwipe to scroll horizontallyGarmin

Australia.Garmin Fenix 7 Pro: Design and screen(Image credit: Michael Sawh)New, clearer screenSame rugged form factorNew flashlight addedThe Fenix 7 Pro like the standard 7 is all about being a watch that\u2019s built for some serious rough and tumble, so unlike Garmin\u2019s Forerunner watches such as the Garmin Forerunner 265, you can expect a thicker case design, more tougher metal and generally a stronger level of protection against water.Like the 7, the 7 Pro comes in three case sizes.Coros Apex 2 Pro will fit the bill, with excellent GPS and adventure credentials.Features score: 4.5/5\u00a0Garmin Fenix 7 Pro: Performance(Image credit: Future)Great multi-band modeEndurance and Hill Scores are nicely presentedSame great battery lifeAll of the good traits from the Fenix 7 are retained for the Pro.Garmin\u2019s great multi-frequency positioning GNSS mode, which improves tracking accuracy in return for sucking up more battery life than other GPS modes, performs really well and Garmin\u2019s mapping support remains the best you\u2019ll find on a watch right now.Along with core running, golfing (there's a reason Garmin fills out a lot of our best golf watches entries), swimming and cycling modes, there are the usual outdoor profiles aplenty covering everything from hiking to surfing, skiing and you're getting activity-specific metrics for most of those profiles as well.On the navigation front, you\u2019ve got preloaded topographic maps, road and trail maps and ski resort maps, with touchscreen support to navigate around those maps.Garmin has enhanced that mapping mode with Relief Shading to offer more detailed maps, the ability to see a split of your metrics and map on one screen and view weather information like temperature, although that isn\u2019t available during the tracking mode screen.You need a few weeks of data to kick things off and while there\u2019s some useful advice offered around those scores they weren\u2019t scores that drastically changed the experience of using the 7 Pro over the regular 7.On top of that screen lies Garmin\u2019s PowerGlass, which does mean you get solar charging powers here to boost the already big battery numbers Garmin promises, as long as you\u2019re spending enough time out in the sun to enjoy the benefits.The 47mm and 42mm Fenix 7 Pro now also grab the LED flashlight from the Fenix 7X, so you now have an extra source of light that can be enabled from the quick settings and can be configured to light up when you\u2019re in tracking mode and is actually a useful extra to have if you don\u2019t want to grab your smartphone.Garmin uses the same charging cable to power it up as the one provided with the Fenix 7 and as a package you\u2019re getting a lovely, well-built watch that doesn\u2019t weigh too heavy or too light and has a screen that\u2019s big enough to make sure you can absorb your real-time stats and view onboard maps.Design score: 5/5Garmin Fenix 7 Pro:

and doesn\u2019t disappoint with the level of features on offer here for those who like to spend more time outside than inside.Make use of the onboard power manager features and turning off features you don\u2019t use and that will make things go further.Performance score: 4.5/5\u00a0Garmin Fenix 7 Pro: Should I buy?Swipe to scroll horizontallyScorecardCategoryCommentScoreDesignA Fenix 7 Solar with the same rough-and-tumble aesthetic, now with added flashlight.Plus, those features are coming to the older Fenix as well.Something that thankfully hasn\u2019t changed with the new hardware and software features on board is the kind of battery life you\u2019ll enjoy on the Fenix 7 Pro.Garmin pairs that with 22mm QuickFit straps, so you\u2019re just a simple button press away from removing it and putting on a new one.You do have Garmin Pay and access to Garmin\u2019s Connect IQ Store, though don\u2019t expect to pile on loads of big-name apps here.I\u2019d say it\u2019s a touch clearer, but there\u2019s not a massive amount in it.Read our full Coros Apex 2 Pro reviewSome changes have been made to the user interface, mainly in the workout mode, but if you were hoping for more smartwatch skills than before, that\u2019s not the case here.Ultimately, this is a watch that can last for weeks, even with regular use of workout tracking, mapping and smartwatch features.Garmin promises the same numbers with up to 22 days in smartwatch mode, which can be boosted by solar charging.Up Ahead also offers trail runners and cyclists the location of Points of Interest nearby.Along with the rich training analysis and metrics you already get on the Fenix 7, Garmin has introduced new Endurance Scores and Hill Scores metrics to help you better understand whether you have put in the right amount of training to handle a hilly route or really go long in training or an endurance event.4.5/5VerdictOne of the best Garmin watches ever, but with a slight lack of innovation4.5/5Buy it if...You want a smaller Fenix with a flashlight\nThe Fenix 7 Pro brings its flashlight down from its bigger 7X watch for those that prefer that extra hit of light from a smaller case design.You want a feature-rich outdoor watch\u00a0\nIf you want a rich array of tracking modes, metrics and the best mapping on a sports watch, that\u2019s what the Fenix 7 Pro will give you.It\u2019s still a display technology that offers good visibility indoors, outside and the responsiveness of the touchscreen support is as good as you\u2019ll find on a sports watch right now.If you\u2019re planning to spend multiple days out on your feet, you can sacrifice the best GPS accuracy and opt for the Expedition mode to get you 40 days of watch time and potentially more again if you can expose the watch to enough sunlight to boost battery.If you want to use the Fenix 7 Pro as a smartwatch, it has the same features as the baseline Fenix 7.It analyses hilly workout history and VO2 Max estimates to score your endurance and ability to tackle hills and make it easy to understand whether it\u2019s good or bad.Many of the Fenix 7 Pro\u2019s training and analysis features are driven by good heart rate data and Garmin has sought to improve things on that front with a new optical heart rate sensor onboard and new algorithms to deliver improved accuracy, particularly when you\u2019re exercising.Read our full Garmin Forerunner 265 reviewCoros Apex 2 Pro\nNeed an even longer battery?Garmin Fenix 7 Pro: One-minute reviewThe Garmin Fenix 7 Pro is a new version of the Fenix 7, which launched in early 2022.The mix of touchscreen and button interaction makes it easy to navigate the now more detailed presentation of those maps as well.The new Endurance and Hill scores are interesting additions to the already rich array of metrics Garmin offers, but how reliable and useful they are going to be for most Fenix 7 Pro users is certainly up for debate.You do still have the ability to pair up external sensors and while the accuracy during workouts has been solid overall, I don\u2019t think you should be ditching that dedicated heart rate monitor just yet.The notification support is the strongest of those smartwatch features and you do have good music player and controls features as well.It\u2019s never going to be as bright as the Epix\u2019 series AMOLED display, but is excellent for battery conservation.",

S. Eliot and reciting something in the same vein as Naming of Cats but where the choosing of earbuds is the difficult matter (\"and I tell you, a listener must have three different sets\").Big.Thus, even our best true wireless earbuds roundup, which features models launched as far back as 2021 (I know!Bravo, Technics.I will admit I didn't see this coming (who did?)What's the most-asked question I get when I tell people I'm a senior audio writer at TechRadar?the top-tier, most expensive option.No, no, people want a definitive answer and hold the complicated reasoning, thank you very much.Good.Anyone remotely interested in portable audio will know that the Sony WF-1000XM5 are the most hotly anticipated audio release of the year, because the Sony WF-1000XM4 upon which they are built were so good.For me, 'best' means flagship territory too: the finest tech and sound quality a brand can offer \u2013 ie.OK, the best wireless earbuds released in 2023 for most people are the Technics EAH-AZ80 and it feels so good to get that off my chest.The contenders include the Sony WF-1000XM5 (July 24, 2023), the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II (September 2022), Apple AirPods Pro 2 (also September 2022) the Bowers & Wilkins Pi7 S2 (January 2023) and Nothing Ear (2), which landed in March 2023.When the XM4 landed in June 2021, they effectively blew everything else on the market away.Remember, we're talking heavy-hitters and flagship products only here, so please don't write in saying it's a crime I haven't mentioned the J-Lab Go Air Pop, great though they are for $20.And now that the biggest names in audio technology have all held their huge conferences for the time being, I truly believe the Technics EAH-AZ80 can relax for a while.But Sony's claim to the throne has been under threat for a little while now and as far as I'm concerned, Technics has just snatched the crown.(While I'm here, we now run a regular feature entitled $20 challenge, which is well worth a look if you're into budget-friendly tech).Got it?It's not just because Technics has delivered triple device multipoint pairing where no other maker has either, including Sony \u2013\u00a0although this excellent perk is also a feature of the company's cheaper EAH-AZ60M2 and entry-level EAH-AZ40M2 too.The Technics EAH-AZ80 cost $299 / \u00a3259 / AU$499 and the Sony WF-1000XM5 will set you back $299.99 / \u00a3259 / AU$499.Technics takes it allThat concha shape may not look comfortable or secure, but it is (Image credit: Future)Essentially, the Technics EAH-AZ80's novel concha design is beautifully secure and you get seven different sizes of silicone earbud in the packaging, versus four with the flagship Sony earbuds.So a solid answer is what I'm going to give you, because nobody wants to hear the ins and outs of my pick for the gym, my high-end option for listening at home and my shout for a cheap waterproof set to stuff in my rain jacket.After all, Apple's WWDC came and went in June without so much as a sniff of the AirPods Max 2 \u2013\u00a0and the AirPods Pro 2 are not yet one year old, so I highly doubt a new offering will land during Apple's traditional September event, which will likely center around the iPhone 15.Positively ancient) is not ideal, even though those products are there for one simple reason: they're still the best.Naturally.I'd been waiting to announce this until after Samsung's Unpacked event, just in case the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 made an appearance, but they did not.The overall build quality of Technics' earbuds feels more premium; there are four mics per earbud (rather than three in the XM5); the Just My Voice tech beats Sony's \"capture voice during a phone call\" toggle and the noise cancellation, companion app and overall sound quality are just that bit better.As well as wanting the best earbuds, ideally we want the newest earbuds, rather than something we could have purchased last year and as such have been missing out on.Easy: what are the best new earbuds with noise cancelling?",

pen options to change the look and feel, and it includes many more templates to write upon.It isn\u2019t difficult to use the Kindle Scribe for basic productivity.Overall, though, if you opt for the 16GB Kindle Scribe with the Basic Pen, there's decent value for what you get.For example, the Kobo Elipsa comes in just one model that boasts 32GB of internal storage and ships with both the stylus and a sleepcover for $399.99 / \u00a3349.99 / AU$599.95 \u2013 so I'm inclined to say the Elipsa offers more value, but the writing experience isn't as smooth.On the other hand, the reMarkable 2 costs a deceptive $299 / \u00a3299 / AU$499.I say deceptive because reMarkable doesn\u2019t include a pen (which the Kindle Scribe and other writing tablets include) and charges exorbitant fees for accessories.If you spring for the leather folio case \u2013 a nice addition that Amazon sent along with my review sample but you'll need to buy it separately \u2013 the flap opens up over the top like a reporter\u2019s notebook, though much larger, similar to the sleepcover for the Kobo Elipsa (which ships with the tablet itself).The USB-C port for charging, as well as the power button are both strangely placed on the side of the device, near the middle, but this isn't unique to the Scribe and can be seen on the Onyx Boox Note series tablets too.When I needed to sign a document, I simply sent it to a custom email address that I set up through my Amazon Kindle account.Still, the screen is much larger than the next-biggest Kindle Oasis' 7-inch display and there's no sacrifice of the remarkable pixel density, so everything is super sharp and glorious on screen.One-minute review(Image credit: Future / Philip Berne)The Kindle Scribe has improved enough since it launched to become my preferred tablet to recommend if you like reading, journaling, and now maybe even old school pen and ink games like crossword puzzles and sudoku.If you need more battery life, the Onyx Boox Note Air 2 Plus is an even better option.Kobo Elipsa\nThe Kindle Scribe is the Elipsa's direct competition \u2013 they're both first and foremost ereaders, just with the added advantage of a pen to write on the tablet with.Should I buy the Kindle Scribe?Buy it ifYou want a really big Kindle for reading books\nSince the Kindle DX disappeared almost 10 years ago, there hasn\u2019t been a truly large-screen reader for Kindle ebook fans.You annotate books using sticky notes\nIf you already make notes in books by writing on Post-it Notes and slipping them in between the pages, the Kindle Scribe will help you do that... just digitally.(Image credit: Future / Philip Berne)Kindle Scribe review: using it\u00a0Excellent large screen Kindle for reading books\u00a0\u00a0Middling E Ink writing tablet for journaling and notes\u00a0(Image credit: Future / Philip Berne)If you want to read books on a large-screen Kindle, the Scribe is an easy ereader to recommend, although the price is high for the category.The reMarkable also doesn\u2019t have a backlight, so you need a light source to use it in the dark.The Scribe costs $90 / \u00a3110 / AU$150 more than the Kindle Oasis, which has only a 7-inch display, half the storage space, and no pen support.The strongest rare earth magnets cannot keep a pen in place when I slide a tablet in and out of a backpack sleeve.The PDF file arrived on my Scribe, and I could sign it and email it back with no trouble.Kindle Scribe specsWeight: 433g\nDimensions: 196 x 230 x 5.8mm\nDisplay size: 10.2-inch\nStorage: 16, 32, 64GB\nCharging: USB-C charging\nBacklight: LED (35 lights)\nPen Included: YesThe Onyx Boox Note Air2 series isn't as widely available, but starts at $499 in the US for the base model.You get pre-filled journaling pages, some crossword and sudoku puzzles, and the promise of more to come.However, the Elipsa gives you far more annotating and note taking options, with the ability to convert handwriting to type, uploading directly to Dropbox and even adding drawings or formulae to notes.If you have a smartphone with the Kindle app, that helps speed the process along, but it isn\u2019t required.There are now \u2018write on\u2019 books in the Kindle store, and those let you write directly on the page on your Kindle Scribe.As soon as I sent a document it appeared in my library, and I could email it from the Kindle Scribe to five recipients.An Audible audiobook on the Kindle Scribe (Image credit: Future / Philip Berne)Of course, there are many more connectivity options I'd like to see, but at this price the options are fair.If this were a more serious productivity tool, that would be a top request, but I've yet to see an alternative E Ink note-taking tablet offer this option.I had no trouble finding my Wi-Fi network, and the Kindle does not need a second device for setup.The only thing the Scribe cannot do is take a dip in the ocean, which the Kindle Oasis can legitimately handle, saltwater and all.The Kindle Scribe is also wider than the reMarkable and Elipsa, and less tall, but has identical overall dimensions as the Onyx Boox Note Air2 tablets.Read our full Onyx Boox Note Air 2 review.It has the biggest screen you can find on a Kindle, while keeping the display just as sharp as the best Kindle ereaders, so books and text look amazing, even better than reading on the best iPad.I could also imagine a microSD card slot being very useful for transferring and signing documents.For that reason, it\u2019s almost twice the price of Amazon\u2019s Kindle Scribe in the US.Of course, let's not forget the iPad 10.2 (2021) which, incidentally only has a 264ppi resolution screen as compared to the Kindle Scribe's 300ppi e ink display, and prices start at $329 / \u00a3319 / AU$499 without a pen for 64GB of storage.Where it differs, other than the obvious size, is the missing page-turn buttons and the asymmetric thickness that I love on the Oasis.If you\u2019re a hardcore handwriter and note-taker, you might prefer the Remarkable 2 tablet, which has many more options for pen styles, background templates, and productivity.The Kindle Scribe has rounded corners and smoothly curved edges with a wide, flat back, which interestingly has four tiny nubs for feet.Sadly, this isn\u2019t Amazon\u2019s fault, and unless you buy books as .pdf files or more industry-specific .epub files, no writing tablet lets you write on any books as you please.Some folks may want an LTE connection at least for downloading books or emailing simple black-and-white documents.I lost the Scribe pen on day one and spent a half hour searching before I found it.If you\u2019ve been craving a gigantic reading screen for bigger fonts and larger images, the Scribe is a joy to use.Amazon does own a bookstore, so it has come up with a solution since the Kindle Scribe launched.And it's got so many options when it comes to note taking, journaling or just doodling.On the other hand, if you\u2019ve been excited about a Kindle that you can also use for journaling, note taking, and other writing tasks, the Kindle Scribe isn't the best tablet you can buy, but it does have plenty of writing features, and you can always buy more journaling books and templates from the Kindle store.For reading, I found the Kindle very comfortable to hold and use, even for such a large tablet.(Image credit: Future / Philip Berne)The pen, which is included, hangs on by a magnet on the opposite side edge of the Scribe.The pen then slots into a holder on the edge of the flap.Updated: July 2023.College students who buy their own books love the ability to interact directly with the text in writing, and it is a huge letdown that no current writing tablet can support this feature on every book you buy.It isn't quite as robust as the reMarkable tablet, but it's a great improvement over the original offering.(Image credit: Future / Philip Berne)The more interesting price comparison is between the Kindle Scribe and other Kindle ereaders.I originally complained that the Kindle Scribe couldn\u2019t write in the margins of books, a feature I would love for students, as a former teacher.The Kindle Scribe keeps things simpler, and this will work better for most people who aren\u2019t using the writing tablet in the boardroom.You can flip the Scribe and hold the larger edge with your right hand, but then the Amazon logo will be frowning.It is smooth as paper, and even that doesn't quite convey how good it really is to write on that screen.Kindle Scribe review: connectivity(Image credit: Future / Philip Berne)Easy setup over Wi-Fi, no device needed\u00a0Send documents to a dedicated email address\u00a0Amazon makes it easy to set up the Kindle Scribe and get all of your books and documents on and off the device.(Image credit: Future / Philip Berne)For journaling and freewriting, the Kindle Scribe offers few template options, and none that work well with popular journal methods.Even as an ereader, it's best used by customers already with existing Prime, Kindle Unlimited or Audible accounts.The writing experience on the Scribe with even its Basic Pen is the best I've experienced to date.There are even more advanced E Ink tablets that use a pen, like the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra.But this will be difficult for anyone without a Kindle account.And I mean the full Play Store.That tablet is a more feature-packed device, and in its own class in terms of capability and price.The possibilities are endless, and I\u2019d love to see Amazon encourage some self-publishing in this \u2018write on\u2019 zone, to build Scribe adoption.Since it launched, Amazon has added more pen options to the Kindle Scribe, including more styles and thickness levels.The Kindle has a very bright LED backlit screen, and it can switch from a bluish-gray tint to a blue light-free tint that\u2019s better for nighttime reading.The Scribe\u2019s cost is also more consumer-friendly.I use bullet journaling and found some basic dots and lined pages, but nothing as organized or creative as the templates I enjoy on the reMarkable 2 tablet.I'd love to see it shed some weight, but it isn\u2019t clumsy.Thankfully, an old Galaxy Note pen works just as well in a pinch.(Image credit: Future / Philip Berne)Compared to the competition, the Kindle Scribe is a bit thicker than the reMarkable 2 tablet \u2013 which makes sense because the reMarkable lacks a backlight \u2013 but is slimmer and sleeker-looking compared to the plastic body of the Kobo Elipsa.Even the Kobo Elipsa offers a lot more when it comes to note-taking, including adding formulae and diagrams in between notes.It has a camera for document scanning and runs Android, for instance.Amazon sells a deluxe version of the Kindle Oasis with 4G LTE connectivity for downloads on the go, so it's a little strange to see the Scribe miss out... although I suspect the price for that privilege would be quite prohibitive for most potential users.Of course, comparing a colorful, extensible tablet like the iPad to the Kindle Scribe is like comparing apples to, er\u2026 Kindles.This is my least favorite way of holding a pen.Kindle Scribe review: designBig and bright display doesn\u2019t sacrifice sharpnessPort and power are weirdly placed on the sideThe Amazon Kindle Scribe looks like a much larger version of the Kindle Oasis, thanks to the all-metal chassis.Check out our reMarkable 2 review.First reviewed: November 2022.It also cannot access the Kindle library, or any large eBook library easily.It has a bezel all around, with a larger edge on the left side, if you hold the tablet Amazon smile-up.If that\u2019s your gig, the Kindle Scribe will help you work.Don't buy it ifYou want to take notes in margins\nNo e ink reader will let you write directly on every book you own, but at least you can still make sticky notes and attach them to specific pages.You\u2019re into journaling and doodling\nThe Kindle Scribe has fewer writing features than some other tablets, though Amazon has added better pen options since the Scribe originally launched.You want to make documents from your written notes\nThe Kindle Scribe can\u2019t convert handwritten notes to type, which is a huge miss for anyone trying to be efficient with note taking and real productivity.Kindle Scribe review: also considerIf our Kindle Scribe review still has you on the fence then consider this trio of alternatives below:Onyx Boox Note Air 2\nThis is hands-down one of the best digital note-takers we've tested.If only it had a backlight for nighttime use, and came with the pen in the box instead of being an optional add-on.For students and academics, the Scribe only allows you to write notes as sticky notes appended to a book.When I needed to sign documents with the Kindle Scribe, I found a dedicated email address @kindle.com was the easiest way.",

            "paraphrased_content": "It has the same sort of pink shade as the Razer and similar keycaps as well.Read them all here.This had obviously left me wondering; if a gaming editor is satisfied using a cheap keyboard for all his gaming needs, and I\u2019m pretty sure thousands of people out there would say the same about their Dollar Store-bought versions, was I misguided in my quest to collect and invest in all these expensive keyboards?And, like the original Razer, it has three light indicators at the top right corner to indicate power, Caps Lock, and backlighting (which is unnecessary because you don\u2019t really need an indicator to let you know whether that backlight is on or off).An ex-colleague has even admitted that he\u2019s been using the same superhero-themed non-mechanical keyboard that he got for free for gaming, saying that it\u2019s served him well for years.$20 challengeThis is the fourth in a regular series of articles in which we test really cheap gadgets to see if they're worth even the small amount of money you'll pay for them.Combine that with the fact that it has a deep actuation (you do have to bottom out the keys for responses), and the experience is really not all that comfortable.(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)Speaking of typing, the keys are wobbly, so wobbly that every single key makes a sound at the slightest touch.(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)Yindiao K500 Luminous: In a nutshellThat isn\u2019t to say that the Yindiao K500 Luminous gaming keyboard is completely useless, and I\u2019ll get into that more later.And some people have on several occasions called me out on my lifestyle choice \u2013 even though there\u2019s an entire community of enthusiasts doing the exact same thing.That is, if you want to replace your keyboard every year or so.Swipe to scroll horizontallyYindiao K500 Luminous: SpecificationsConnectivity: USB wiredSwitches: MembraneBacklighting: Yes, white, not customizableYindiao K500 Luminous gaming keyboard: DesignDisappointment immediately set in as soon as I received this keyboard in the mail.Like I said, it\u2019s gotten a lot of five-star ratings on the site, many praising it for its cute aesthetic, lightweight design, and good performance.(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)Yindiao K500 Luminous: FeaturesBecause the Yindiao K500 is a bargain-basement product, there aren\u2019t a lot of features to speak of.What did you expect?Yindiao K500 Luminous: PerformanceAdmittedly, the Yindiao K500 delivers good performance, and by that, I mean you can type with it all day long and not experience any issues or delays.And it is a full-sized keyboard, giving you access to the whole set of keys, from the arrow keys to the numpad.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)(Image credit: Future / Michelle Rae Uy)Up close, however, things start to unravel.Also unlike the original, this one has a thinner profile, which means it\u2019s kinder to your wrist and less bulky.However, it\u2019s just not a good gaming keyboard.I immediately experienced wrist and hand fatigue within 30 minutes of using it, which may be ok for a lot of people but is definitely not if you\u2019re in the know.Plus, there\u2019s a lot of space between the keycaps and the top case for the white backlighting to really shine through, which does improve how it looks.It is a USB wired keyboard so it\u2019s essentially a plug-and-play.But that\u2019s pretty much it.I\u2019m not saying throw a wad of cash on the table for a premium gaming keyboard, especially if you\u2019re not a collector like me, but the Yindiao K500 Luminous is proof that a bargain-basement keyboard is not the best route, especially if you take your gaming seriously.It\u2019s ok for typing, if you don\u2019t mind that constant annoyance of the wobble and the squeaks and experiencing wrist fatigue within an hour of using it.It\u2019s lightweight and the pink variant that I got really does look like the Razer BlackWidow V3 from afar, like from a few feet away if you\u2019re near-sighted.Save your money for a better option is my recommendation here.It certainly pales in comparison to the original, not just in build but also in speed and comfort.$20 challenge: Is it worth it?In addition, there are two front feet for a better angle.But, seeing as it is a wired keyboard, that\u2019s kind of the bare minimum you can expect really \u2013 although it does experience a bit of lag when you first plug it in or when you\u2019re waking it.Because it is a membrane keyboard, you\u2019re getting squishy keys.Anyone who knows me knows that I collect the best keyboards.The keycaps aren\u2019t any better, either.There is backlighting that you can turn off if that\u2019s distracting to you, but you only get the white color, which really isn\u2019t fun when you\u2019re gaming.In fact, save your money and go the Razer route instead, or check out our Logitech MX Mechanical vs Razer Pro Type Ultra, if you can't decide between the two top-performing mechanical keyboards.Like its build, for instance.Like a little mouse getting tortured.It\u2019s also not really the fastest keyboard either.I didn\u2019t just choose a random keyboard off of the notoriously cheap e-commerce website, by the way; I actually chose one that actually looks good and premium in the photos and currently enjoys a 4.5 out of 5 rating with over 780 reviews, many of which are five stars.And let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m sticking with my life choices.And while I agree with them to some degree, I\u2019m not entirely convinced.At only $14.23 (Temu says it\u2019s really $32.19 but discounted 55%, like we should all just pretend that online stores don\u2019t do that to make products more appealing to people), it is an absolute steal.While Yindiao makes no mention of its polling rate, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not ideal for fast-paced, especially considering that you do have to bottom out every key for presses to register.I spend a lot of money on them too, shelling out $150 or more on a top-tier mechanical keyboard that looks just as good as it performs.That\u2019s good in that it\u2019s actually very lightweight; bad in that if this thing falls off your desk the wrong way, that case will crack.And I honestly wouldn\u2019t count on its build to last all that long when you\u2019re button-mashing.And don\u2019t even get me started on the spacebar, which makes a squeaking noise every time you press it \u2013 and I mean every single time!Get it, and you\u2019ll spend even more because you\u2019re likely to keep buying a replacement.I would say save your cash, and get a better quality option.Have I been wasting my money all along?Umm, not so much.I bought a $15 keyboard off of Temu that looks very and shamelessly similar to the famed Razer BlackWidow V3, one of the best gaming keyboards out there, to test this.Unlike the Razer BlackWidow V3, this keyboard is clearly made of cheap, thin plastic \u2013 so thin you can actually see some backlight bleed through its thinly-painted top case.It came in a box that was flimsy enough to be partially crushed during transit, and I could already tell that the item inside wasn\u2019t going to be any better.To its credit, the Yindiao K500 Luminous does have its advantages.",

Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow.In Wordle, you can instead try several of those in succession and hope one is right, assuming you have enough guesses left.The website also includes a practice mode - which I definitely recommend using before attempting the game proper!Quordle today (game #551) - hint #2 - total vowelsWhat is the total number of vowels in Quordle today?\u2022 The total number of vowels across today's Quordle answers is 10.Quordle today (game #551) - hint #3 - repeated lettersDo any of today's Quordle answers contain repeated letters?\u2022 The number of Quordle answers containing a repeated letter today is 0.Quordle today (game #551) - hint #4 - total lettersHow many different letters are used in Quordle today?\u2022 The total number of different letters used in Quordle today is 11.Quordle today (game #551) - hint #5 - uncommon lettersDo the letters Q, Z, X or J appear in Quordle today?\u2022 No.6. Letters can appear more than once.There are two key things to remember.Quordle is the only one of the many Wordle clones that I'm still playing now, around 18 months after the daily-word-game craze hit the internet, and with good reason: it's good fun, but also difficult.What's more, its makers (now the online dictionary Merriam-Webster) are also keeping it fresh in the form of a new variant called the Daily Sequence, which sees you complete four puzzles consecutively, rather than concurrently.In the scenario above, CLAMP would be a great guess, as it could point the way to four of the seven words in one go.There are plenty of other options - you might want to get an M, B, F or G in there instead of the H, maybe - but something like that should do the trick.Oh, and it's difficult.1.For instance, I currently use STARE > DOILY > PUNCH.But Quordle is tough, so if you already find yourself searching for Wordle hints, you'll probably need some for this game too.3. Letters that are not in the answer turn gray\u2026\n4.So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green.You can't guess ABCDE, for instance.I'm a Quordle and Wordle fanatic who's been playing since December 2021, so I can definitely help you solve Quordle today and improve your game for tomorrow.The first of these should probably be one of the best Wordle starting words, because the same things that make them work well will apply here too.If you're not ready yet then here's one more clue to make things a lot easier:Quordle today (game #551) - hint #7 - starting letters (2)What letters do today's Quordle answers start with?\u2022 V\n\u2022 A\n\u2022 A\n\u2022 LRight, the answers are below, so DO NOT SCROLL ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM.Today's best Get Better At Wordle deals22 Amazon customer reviews\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u00a33.67View\u00a34.11View\u00a36.99ViewShow More DealsWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesQuordle today (game #551) - the answers(Image credit: Merriam-Webster)The answers to today's Quordle, game #551, are\u2026VALUEALONGALIVELEASTHow did you do today?And rather than complete them in turn, you do so simultaneously.- and there are daily stats including a streak count.5.If not, well good luck!You also get Quordle Achievements - specific badges for winning a game in a certain number of turns, playing lots of times, or guessing particularly hard words.* Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too).Between them, these three words use 15 of the 26 letters in the alphabet including all five vowels, Y, and nine of the most common consonants (S, T, R, D, L, P, N, C and H).You get nine guesses, rather than the six for Wordle, but the rules are otherwise very similar.With four puzzles to solve in nine guesses, you can't blindly throw letters at it and expect to win - you'll stand a far better chance if you think strategically.9.Yes, he takes it all too seriously.2.As with Wordle, the answers are the same for every player each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world.And also as with Wordle, the puzzle resets at midnight so you have a fresh challenge each day.Send me an email and let me know.Daily Sequence today (game #551) - the answers(Image credit: Merriam-Webster)The answers to today's Quordle Daily Sequence, game #551, are\u2026AWAITWHICHWHOLEMAPLEQuordle answers: The past 20Quordle #550, Friday 28 July: TOTEM, BASAL, PULSE, COUCHQuordle #549, Thursday 27 July: EVADE, SPICE, FLOAT, ALIGNQuordle #548, Wednesday 26 July: INDEX, TAKER, CURVE, PEACHQuordle #547, Tuesday 25 July: HAIRY, ROWDY, QUARK, LIMITQuordle #546, Monday 24 July: STUFF, HIPPO, LIVER, BLINKQuordle #545, Sunday 23 July: ENTRY, GIDDY, STAMP, VOMITQuordle #544, Saturday 22 July: BEFIT, JIFFY, ARENA, TOUCHQuordle #543, Friday 21 July: ROUND, TEPID, LIVER, IRATEQuordle #542, Thursday 20 July: ENTER, TRULY, USUAL, CIVILQuordle #541, Wednesday 19 July: WORST, KAYAK, HENCE, ZEBRAQuordle #540, Tuesday 18 July: DEBUT, HOARD, SILLY, UPPERQuordle #539, Monday 17 July: LUPUS, ALIVE, SALLY, ABLEDQuordle #538, Sunday 16 July: STEAM, SALTY, SLOOP, TRUSSQuordle #537, Saturday 15 July: CYCLE, FALSE, FRILL, HEAVYQuordle #536, Friday 14 July: LIBEL, CABLE, WREAK, SCOPEQuordle #535, Thursday 13 July: BASTE, QUERY, SNAIL, PEARLQuordle #534, Wednesday 12 July: VOICE, MANGA, FROTH, BLOATQuordle #533, Tuesday 11 July: MODEL, AISLE, LIMBO, TULLEQuordle #532, Monday 10 July: FILET, DULLY, IRATE, NOSEYQuordle #531, Sunday 9 July: AXION, OFFER, DREAD, SADLYQuordle FAQs: Everything you need to knowWhat is Quordle?Where Wordle challenges you to guess a new five-letter word each day, Quordle presents you with four puzzles to solve.Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green.",

to grab some extra storage.That's a 40 percent discount and matches the sale price from Prime Day.The buds have one of the best transparency modes of all the buds we've tried, and we think they're the best pick for people who use iPhones.If you pre-order the foldable on Amazon, you can get a free $200 Amazon Gift Card and a storage upgrade to 512GB.Xbox Series X\n\n\n\nPhoto by Aaron Souppouris / Engadget\n\n\nXbox Series X + Forza Horizon 5 Bundle\n\n\n$450\n$560\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $110\n                \n            \n\nThis rare discount on Microsoft's top-end Xbox also includes the well-regarded racing game Forza Horizon 5 for no extra cost.Among other announcements, the company officially unveiled its latest foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Z Fold 5.That's not quite an all time low, as it went for $10 less during last year's Black Friday deals and the most recent Prime Day sale, but is still a tidy discount.It plays for 12 hours on a charge and can even pair with other Bose speakers for stereo sound.The internal tech is identical to a standard Kindle, with a 300 ppi screen, adjustable front light, 16GB of storage and weeks of battery life.$160 at Target\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe named the Powerbeats Pro the most comfortable option in our guide to workout headphones.The controls are intuitive, iOS integration is great and the comfortable, behind-the-ear hooks are easy to get in place and stay put (though they can interfere with sunglasses).The Pencil makes drawing and hand-writing on your tablet easier and it even magnetically attaches and charges to the side of compatible devices.This latest generation has a sharper and brighter display and has an updated processor and larger battery that offers a claimed eight hours of use after just eight minutes of charging.That's a price they've hit many times before, but matches their all time low.But now you can get it from Walmart or target as well as from Amazon.The buds are back down to $249 at both Amazon and directly from Bose.Dell did this discount before, but didn't offer a game.A good battery life and a wireless charging case are just two more points in the buds' favor.Nintendo has the fast-paced first-person shooter (but with cards for weapons) Neon White for 30 percent off and the rollerblading, '70s drenched shooter, Rollerdrome is half price at Steam.$600 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung's 32-inch M8 Smart Monitor is part computer monitor and part smart TV, meaning it can do everything a monitor can do when hooked up to a PC, but you may never need to do that.That matches the lowest price we've tracked for the 256GB base model and $100 savings.Apple Pencil\n\n\n\nPhoto by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget\n\n\nApple Pencil (2nd Gen)\n\n\n$89\n$129\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $40\n                \n            \n\nThe Apple Pencil is a great accessory for your iPad, and makes drawing and note-taking much more fun and accurate.All on its own, it can stream Netflix, Disney+, Peacock and other services just by connecting to your WiFi.Non-PS exclusives are also on sale, like the time-bending FPS Deathloop ($15), the sci-fi RPG Cyberpunk 2077 ($25) and one of our favorite co-ops, It Takes Two ($16).The self-emptying base means less involvement from you and the setup only takes a few minutes so it can quickly get to work making your floors cleaner.Samsung Galaxy Watch 6\u00a0\n\n\n\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford / Engadget\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 (40mm) with an $50 Amazon gift card and Fabric

users in our guide to those devices.It can also act as your smart home display to control your smart devices and keep tabs on your connected cams and doorbells.PlayStation Summer

of several deals included in the PlayStation Summer Sale, which kicked off this week.$10 at Xbox\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo game companies and retailers often celebrate the summer months with some sort of sale on popular titles \u2014 maybe because gaming indoors beats heat-fusing to the pavement outside.Plenty of single items are seeing discounts as well, like the always popular Apple AirPods Pro and the Kids Kindle (which isn't just for kids).They pair quickly with other Apple devices and make great use of Siri for hands-free commands.Epic Games Store Summer

you get two Thunderbolt ports, a headphone jack and a MagSafe charging port.Red Dead Redemption 2 is down to $20, for one, while the remasters Mass Effect Legendary Edition and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 are available for $15 and $16, respectively.$80 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kindle Kids ereader is a top pick in our guide to educational toys for kids.$30 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few different Kasa smart plugs are currently on sale at Amazon, including the Kasa KP125M, which is our pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our guide to smart plugs.We gave them an Engadget score of 86 when they came out in 2019.It usually goes for $120, which is $20 more than the standard Kindle, but the sale is knocking it down to just $80, making it a good buy for a kid or even a full-grown adult who enjoys saving money.It offers nearly the best sequential write performance of the cards we tested and bested all cards for for random read/write speeds.$300 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung also revealed two new wearables during Unpacked.We gave the ultraportable an impressive 96 in our review, calling it a \u201cnear-perfect Mac.\u201d It has a Liquid Retina display, a quad speaker array and a battery that lasted over 16 hours in our video tests.It also looks pretty premium, with its copper accents and sleek design.The 23 percent discount is the steepest discount so far, matching the Prime Day sale price.Right now it's down to $89 at Amazon, Target and Walmart, which is the same low it hit during Amazon's Prime Day sale.It's not even available yet, but Amazon is offering a $200 gift card if you pre-order from its site.In our tests it paired easily (though required a few extra steps for Apple's system) and stayed reliably connected.Other site-wide sales include 20 percent off at Otterbox and a sale on music equipment at Reverb.iRobot Roomba s9+\n\n\n\niRobot\n\n\nRoomba s9+\n\n\n$600\n$1,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

QuietComfort Earbuds II offer the best noise cancellation you can buy and recommend them in our guide.Of all the finding networks out there, Apple's FindMy is by far the most comprehensive as it uses every iPhone in an area (unless the owner has opted out) to ping nearby AirTags and help find them when they're lost.Some of our recommended Xbox exclusives are going for less than $10, including Gears 5, Ori and the Will of the Wisps and Rare Replay.The watch starts at $300 for the 40mm case size and bumps to $330 for the 44mm size.If you pre-order the Galaxy Watch 6 from Amazon, the company will throw in a $50 Amazon gift card.The set will cover up to 7,200 square feet but if you don't need that much coverage, the single unit and two-unit packs are also on sale, though aren't as steeply discounted.Otterbox Back to School sale\n\n\n\nWill Lipman Photography for Engadget\n\n\nOtterbox Fast Charge power bank 15,000\n\n\n$36\n$45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $9\n                \n

strong ANC, good sound quality and excellent transparency mode.That brings the studio pack down to $299, which is the usual price of the interface on its own, which means you're getting the included Volt condenser mic and Volt headphones for free.The PS5 remake of the original The Last of Us is on sale for $50, while the well-reviewed puzzler Humanity is $24.Right now a four-pack is down to $85 at Amazon, which is the lowest price we've tracked.The bank packs enough charge to fill a late-model iPhone or a Galaxy S-series twice, with a little left over.That's the same as they went for during Amazon's Prime Day.One of their battery banks, the Fast Charge, is among our top picks in our portable battery guide.Engadget's Cherlynn Low had a chance to check out the watch during a hands on event and you can check out her thoughts here.$330 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your WiFi connectivity could use a boost, it may be time to invest in an mesh router system.Elsewhere, the action-game-meets-delivery-sim Death Stranding: Director's Cut is on sale for $20, and Dead Island 2, the zombie action-RPG that was released in April, is available for $45.The Flex is compact, but manages to give bright, dynamic sound and offers a surprising amount of bass for its size.It's the budget pick in our MacBook buyer\u2019s guide, and the one we recommend to students or anyone who needs a reliable machine for casual computing.It comes in a bundle with a copy of the open-world racing game Forza Horizon 5 for a total of $450.Right now Xbox is hosting an Ultimate Game Sale with deals up to 80 percent off.That matches the price it hit during Amazon's recent sale.The Volt 276 is one of our top picks in our audio interface guide and we gave it a 90 in our review.$199 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest generation AirPods Pro are back to their all-time low price of $199.A few deals worth calling out include the Novation Summit synth for $460 off of $2,300 and Universal Audio's Volt 276 studio pack for $130 off of $429.$49 at Headspace\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've recommended Headspace a few times in our guides because it's an intuitive app that can actually help you relax.Engadget's Sam Rutherford spent some time with the new foldable recently.They're a little older at this point and the over-ear design doesn't block out any noise but they're currently $90 off the MSRP, which is around $40 less than what they've been going for lately and matches their Prime Day sale price on Amazon.$750 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n                        $750 at Best Buy\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lowest price on a MacBook in Apple's current lineup is on the 2020 MacBook Air with the M1 chip, which is down to just $750 at both Amazon and at Best Buy for the 256GB base model.To help you take advantage of Samsung's new one-click mechanism, Amazon will also include a fabric band to swap out with the included strap.$1,800 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Samsung announced its latest flagship foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 during its Unpacked event.Outside of Epic's sale, two more of our favorite games from 2022 are discounted.We like the Deco XE75 because the WiFi 6E routers support all three wireless bands (including the 6GHz band) and offers a great mix of power, user-friendliness and affordability \u2014 particularly when it's discounted.They'll also ring when you tap a button in the app so you can find your lost keys.Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II\n\n\n\nPhoto

for the \"best noise cancellation\" pick in our guide to the best wireless earbuds.Right now a year-long subscription is 30 percent off, making it $49 instead of $70.The Kasa EP25 plug is our top pick overall and also connects to all four major smart home eco systems.Here are the best tech deals from this week that you can still get today.Kindle Kids\n\n\n\nAmazon\n\n\nKindle Kids (2022)\n\n\n$80\n$120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $40\n                \n            \n\nTake 33 percent off of the Amazon Kindle Kids e-reader in a deal that matches its Prime Day low price.Engadget's Valentina Palladino found it to be a powerful machine that was better than most at navigating around furniture and other objects and despite having excellent suction, it actually moves faster than its cheaper sibling, the j7.Even if you don't care about racing, this may be a good time to buy, considering the Xbox Series X console (or its cheaper, digital-only Series S sibling) will be a required purchase for the upcoming Bethesda game Starfield, unless you plan to play on a PC.Though, to be fair, this isn't a toy.The top pick from our guide, TP-Link\u2019s Deco XE75, is currently down to $330 for the three-pack instead of its usual $400.The most notable upgrade from last year's model is Samsung's new Flex Hinge, which eliminates most of the gap between the two screen halves when folded.Of course, many sale items are also available with an Xbox Game Pass subscription, so if you already subscribe, check that availability first.Samsung Galaxy Z Fold

year of Amazon Kids+, a subscription that grants access to thousands of kid-appropriate books and hundreds of audiobooks.The folks at Amazon are hoping you'll pre-order the handset from them \u2014 and are offering a $200 Amazon gift card plus a storage upgrade if you do so.This week also saw a bunch of continued video game sales from sites like Xbox, Playstation and Epic Games.$89 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n                        $89 at Target\n                \n\n\n                        $89 at Walmart\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a recent model of an iPad Air, Mini or Pro and have been considering adding a stylus to your setup, you may want to consider grabbing the second-gen Apple Pencil while its on sale for $89.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.The base configuration of the Z Fold 5 retails for $1,800, which comes with 256GB of storage.$36 at Otterbox\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe often recommend products from Otterbox in our guides and from now through July 29th, the site is running a site-wide, 20 percent off sale.Matter connectivity means it'll work with Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Samsung SmartThings and Google Home, so whichever voice assistant you prefer should be supported.Just remember that they don't offer wireless charging and don't have multipoint connectivity, meaning you can only pair with one device at a time.$12 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n                        $13 at Samsung\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung's Pro Plus microSD card is what we recommend for most people, based on our tests.Engadget's Terrance O'Brian appreciates its all-analog emulation of \"one of the most iconic compressors of all time\" and said most other interfaces at this price point can't match the 276's stylish and ergonomic design.The 15,000mAh capacity model usually goes for $45, but is $36 after the discount.It's currently $38 for a four-pack after a 24 percent discount.Apple MacBook Air M1\n\n\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar / Engadget\n\n\nApple MacBook Air M1\n\n\n$750\n$999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $249\n                \n            \n\nThis matches the lowest price we've seen for the base model of Apple's M1 MacBook Air.It also recharges quickly and looks nice, something not all charging accessories manage to do.$600 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur top pick for a premium robot vacuum, the iRobot Roomba s9+, has returned to it's record low of $600 at Amazon.It was the most consistent card we tested.Samsung PRO Plus microSD\n\n\n\nPhoto by Jeff Dunn / Engadget\n\n\nSamsung Pro Plus (128GB)\n\n\n$12\n$19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $7\n                \n            \n\nit's a good time to grab one or a few of Samsung's Pro Plus microSD cards as they're just $12 for the 128GB size.Apple Air Tags (4-pack)\n\n\n\nEngadget\n\n\nApple AirTag 4 Pack\n\n\n$85\n$99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

            "paraphrased_content": "Don't try it if...You\u2019re not enamored with getting yet another subscription service, and would need the sort of powerful tools found in the best photo editors and dedicated software.While the Shutterstock service has long been hailed as one of the best free stock photo sites on the web, there\u2019s more to the creative platform than assets and content library.There are so many to choose from, all organized by category, such as Facebook Covers, YouTube Thumbnails, and Instagram Stories.However, we think it\u2019s a bit of a stretch to include it in the Creative Flow+ sidebar, as the results generated aren\u2019t actually part of your subscription.Put simply, it\u2019s a combination of web-based apps and graphic design software designed to help you organize yourself, and produce visual content to promote and market your business.As such, it comes with five separate apps, all accessible from the interface\u2019s sidebar on the left.The focus is certainly on social media, but Create also has ready-made canvases for print, such as Flyers, Invitations or Brochures for instance.But choosing the right template or canvas size is but the start.Creative Flow+: Pricing & plansA service that\u2019s included in Shutterstock subscriptions, available as a standalone product with a free trial\u00a0Creative Flow+ is a standalone subscription, independent of the rest of Shutterstock\u2019s offerings.It\u2019s even possible to link to collections you\u2019ve already created to make sure all assets for a project stay together.\u2018Predict\u2019 is an AI-based tool to speed up the creation process of posts aimed at Facebook, Instagram or Pinterest.Now of course, the more uncluttered the background, the easier it will be for Create to excise the foreground from it, and we did encounter some whose composition was too complex for Create to handle.It would be more user-friendly if some overlay could be displayed on the thumbnail to tell us at a glance which are free and which aren\u2019t.Creative Flow+\u2019s text tools are quite broad and extensive (Image credit: Shutterstock)Add an image to your canvas, and perhaps one of the most useful and impressive tools is \u2018Remove Background\u2019.Still, maybe that\u2019s why Predict is still in beta.\u2018Catalog\u2019 offers a quick link to your collections, assets and designs, making it easy to manage them all from the same place.Although it\u2019s important to note that when you subscribe to one of Shutterstock\u2019s monthly or annual plans, you\u2019ll get Creative Flow+ included for free.If you don\u2019t need access to those plans, Creative Flow+ will cost you $13 per month, or $120 per year, and if you\u2019re curious about the service, there\u2019s a free month\u2019s trial on offer as well, removing any reason you might have to not try it out.The real fun begins in Create\u2019s editing section.You\u2019ll find a wealth of tools to work with.After a few seconds you\u2019ll be presented with four images.Don\u2019t like what you see?\u2018Plan\u2019, for instance, is a calendar, made to keep you and your team organized.You can, of course, start a design from scratch, but templates are one of the biggest draws here.There was something we kept quiet about in our recent Shutterstock review.But to be honest, aside from setting the right aspect ratio for your project, it\u2019s hard to discern what the templates on offer have that the templates available in Create don\u2019t.By default you have no \u2018Style\u2019 set, giving the AI free reign over what to produce, but you can narrow down the outcome to Photo, Art, Digital, 3D or Scene if you like, and also choose from one of the displayed keywords.The most interesting option which caught our eye was \u2018Zoom out\u2019, available on every thumbnail.If you\u2019re familiar with the concept of text-to-image AI art generators, it\u2019s pretty much the same here: type in a description of what you\u2019d like to see, add as many keywords as you can think of, and click on \u2018Generate\u2019.You can color correct your image of course, crop it, erase sections, or even animate their appearance onto your canvas, should you be working on a project that supports such action.There\u2019s a wealth of graphics you can add and customize, a selection of brushes for freehand drawing, and a vast choice of fonts you can add to your project.And everything is layer-based, meaning you can reorder objects with ease, lock them into place, or even delete them altogether.Of course, Create can\u2019t hope to compete with dedicated software, but the wealth of features found in those programs can be overwhelming, especially if you\u2019re new to content creation (or you just need to build a lot of assets fast).Yet here you have in your hands a lot of options that can help you create relatively complex designs in very little time, ready to download and use to promote your work or product.In order to facilitate the process you can provide it with images from Shutterstock\u2019s library, upload some from your own collection, or just skip that step to see what Predict can\u2026 well\u2026 predict for you.If you like them, you\u2019ll have to pay for them via a separate Shutterstock subscription or through the purchase of on-demand packs.Generate: 3/5Creative Flow+: CreateCreative Flow+ has many editing tools at your disposal, including a powerful background remover, filters, effects, and more (Image credit: Shutterstock)An impressive array of tools to design content in your browser, although there are some limitations\u00a0\u2018Create\u2019 is the real star of the show.It\u2019s also effortless to duplicate your

but its output isn\u2019t part of your Creative Flow+ subscription\u00a0AI is everywhere - and that includes Creative Flow+.However when it works, it works very well, and you\u2019re given some simple tools to refine the results.You also have a selection of \u2018Pro Effects\u2019 at your disposal - they\u2019re fun to use but they have no obvious editable options.There are also a series of online companion apps, available under the banner Creative Flow+.Think of it as a simplified version of Photoshop - a Photoshop alternative that uses templates to get you started fast.You can try

            "paraphrased_content": "It\u2019s taken 10 years to get here, but it\u2019s now a solid, quantifiable fact: There\u2019s a lot of money in indie games.With Netflix\u2019s resources, the Night School team was able to add day-one support for 32 languages in Oxenfree II, and they were able to fly in remote collaborators as needed.They clearly have a brand and an aesthetic directive \u2026 if I can keep making games for them for a long time, I will.\u201d\nThe new normal works for Ruiz \u2014 and Flesser, Krankel, Medeiros and plenty of others.For the moment, this shift is powering a small but highly visible boom in the world of indie games.The game has a complex premise \u2014 it stars Clem, a desert bounty hunter with plenty of baggage, and it involves mech battles, emotional narrative scenes and home-management mechanics, including some light gardening.For now, it\u2019s a functional system, even if it ultimately leaves publishers, rather than independent developers, with most of the power.Like, they're not averse to scale.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just Annapurna making these types of deals with indies nowadays.For now, bespoke publishing is the name of the indie game.It\u2019s already brought a number of high-profile titles to mobile devices, including Kentucky Route Zero, Poinpy, Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, Lucky Luna and Oxenfree II, and it\u2019s purchased a few studios outright \u2014 notably, Alphabear developer Spry Fox and Oxenfree house Night School Studio.If [Annapurna is] into a thing that they think is a good move, and it needs more people, that seems to be fully okay.There are two big benefits of working with Netflix, according to Snowman creative director Jason Medeiros: The instant access to an audience of more than 230 million people, and the freedom to build a game without worrying about monetization.Bounty StarAnnapurna Interactive\n\u201cEverything favors a publisher relationship, seemingly, because self-publishing has become this extraordinarily difficult thing,\u201d Ruiz said.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re just trying to grab a thing that will make money or collaborate with people that are just going to make them money.This is the new standard for indie developers: Identify the publisher that best matches your game\u2019s tone, pitch it, and pray.This system had fully imploded by 2012: On the heels of breakout hits like Braid, Super Meat Boy and Fez, the indie market was overrun by new games and developers, and Steam dropped its curation efforts.\u201cI hope Annapurna\u2019s success means more Annapurnas in the future,\u201d Ruiz said.It was founded in 2016 as an offshoot of Annapurna Pictures and quickly established its brand as an arthouse publisher, focused on visually innovative and emotionally driven experiences.\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but without help, I just don't know how anyone's doing it \u2026 I got a lot of friends in the same boat.\u201d\nRuiz\u2019s career is a microcosm of the shifting landscape for indie developers over the past 10 years.StrayAnnapurna Interactive\nAnnapurna Interactive is one of the most prominent publishers of indie games today, with titles like Stray, Outer Wilds, Neon White, Donut County and What Remains of Edith Finch on its books.Like, for instance, Ben Ruiz.It's a breath of fresh air; we jump on opportunities to make games that way.\u201d\nOf course, there are still developers self-publishing their projects \u2014 Vampire Survivors, Phasmophobia, Celeste and Among Us are all standout examples \u2014 but there\u2019s a murkier path to success with this model, one based on timing, trends and a hefty amount of luck.It shifted to a community-voting approach called Greenlight, before eventually landing on the everything-goes Early Access model we know today.The streaming company officially entered the game-distribution business in 2021, and it\u2019s on track to have 100 titles in its library by the end of 2023, all freely available to anyone with a Netflix subscription.Sony is taking a similar approach, though it owns fewer studios than Microsoft.\u201cThe fact that Dinogod has five full time people, that was a part of the partnership,\u201d Ruiz said.There are more than 90,000 games on Steam today; Xbox Game Pass and PS Plus Premium libraries each have more than 400 titles (and counting).There were 309 games added to Steam in 2010; in 2017, there were 6,306.So much money that outside companies are popping up and trying to get a piece of the pie \u2014 and for now, it\u2019s created a shiny bubble of pretty PR packages and bespoke showcases dedicated to small teams and their games.For anyone with an eye on video game news, it\u2019s been hard to ignore the recent rise of names like Annapurna Interactive, Devolver Digital, Private Division, Humble, Epic Games and Netflix tied to independent projects.\u201cAnd now in the last few years, literally, it's non-stop.\u201d\nThe acquisition allowed Night School to move into the Netflix offices and it provided stability for the studio overall, Krankel said.GrisDevolver Digital\nIt\u2019s difficult to ignore the potential for exploitation down the line, especially with Netflix in the mix.\u201cI don't think I ever want to self-publish again.\u201d\nBen Ruiz has been a game developer since 2005, and in that time, he\u2019s pretty much done it all.It\u2019s this fantasy world with no currency, even, and all that\u2019s intentional.Nowadays, Ruiz is running a five-person studio called Dinogod and he\u2019s building Bounty Star, a game that blends mech combat with life-sim mechanics.The first of these purchases was Night School, which Netflix acquired in 2021.Microsoft and Sony are also signing hundreds of one-off deals with indies as they attempt to fill their streaming libraries \u2014 Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus Premium \u2014 with a steady stream of new experiences.Annapurna, for its part, was accused of mishandling claims of abuse at three prominent studios on its publishing roster \u2014 Mountains, Funomena and Fullbright \u2014 in a March 2022 documentary by People Make Games.\u201cAll that's really exciting,\u201d Oxenfree II lead developer Bryant Cannon said just ahead of the game\u2019s July 12th release.Sayonara Wild HeartsAnnapurna Interactive\n\u201cI think for us as a studio, the biggest change is working with a publisher, something which we would see as completely uninteresting and impractical ten years ago,\u201d Simogo co-founder Simor Flesser told Engadget earlier this month.Snowman is best known as the name behind Alto\u2019s Adventure and Alto\u2019s Odyssey, and its latest project is Laya\u2019s Horizon, a serene wingsuit experience exclusive to Netflix.Because I mean, I liked games before all that stuff happened.Annapurna bit, and Ruiz landed a publishing deal.He founded two studios, he did contract work on titles including Super Meat Boy and Overland, and he independently published a tentpole original project, the monochromatic brawler Aztez.Even with a hefty amount of hype behind it, Aztez had trouble standing out, and that was the last time Ruiz tried self-publishing.\u201cI think the game is going to be better because we have this battery in our back.\u201d\nOxenfree IINetflix\nOutside of acquisitions, Netflix is also signing individual deals with developers.And then there\u2019s Netflix.Devolver Digital is the granddaddy of indie publishers, and since 2009 it\u2019s released hits including Hotline Miami, Hatoful Boyfriend, The Talos Principle, Gris, Fall Guys, Inscryption, Weird West and Cult of the Lamb, all in collaboration with small development teams.The distribution process for indie developers has shifted over the past few years from a self-publishing-first model, to one that prioritizes deal-making and acquisitions.This system has already distributed innovative and important games to huge audiences \u2014 Tchia, Tunic, Sea of Solitude, Gris \u2014 and it\u2019s offered stability to a lot of independent artists.Bounty Star is being published by Annapurna Interactive and it\u2019s due out in early 2024.Its showcases are now a staple of the gaming calendar.Meanwhile, the current consolidation craze is shrinking the video game industry overall, even as the market caps of the biggest companies continue to rise.You don't have to do that stuff.\u201cYou'll notice real quick that the game that you've been playing can't be free-to-play,\u201d Medeiros told Engadget in April.\u201cConsolidation \u2014 I didn't really have my finger as much on the pulse of that, because when we joined Netflix, it didn't feel like that was happening so rapidly,\u201d Night School co-founder Sean Krankel told Engadget.Annapurna is handling the marketing for Bounty Star, and it\u2019s also financially supporting Ruiz\u2019s studio, Dinogod.\u201cWhen everything was greenlit, that was the first step, to bring in these five or six people\u2026.Ruiz and his business partner built Aztez in between contract projects, and by the time it was ready to debut on Steam in 2017, the indie market was saturated.Simogo\u2019s latest projects, Sayonara Wild Hearts and Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, are the result of its partnership with Annapurna.Even established studios, such as Device 6 creator Simogo, have swapped to a publisher-first model.\u201cLike, where would the ads go?Meanwhile, Microsoft\u2019s strategy is to simply acquire the studios it likes, and today it has 23 developers under the Xbox Game Studios banner.When Ruiz pitched the game, he was clear that he\u2019d need a team of five or six people to bring his vision to life, and Annapurna gave him the funding to hire up.Amid the ongoing writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strike, the company is facing accusations that it instituted wildly unfair compensation deals for creatives, paying out one-time, minimal wages even as projects became massive hits on the streaming service.So having a platform like Netflix, it's just like, none of that matters.He began working on Aztez in 2010, when Steam was a curated marketplace where Valve employees hand-selected individual games for the platform.As the creative director, I didn't want any of that stuff.Ruiz did contract work for a while after Aztez, and in 2018 he pitched Bounty Star to people he knew at Annapurna.There\u2019s also Humble, Private Division, Raw Fury, Epic Games, Finji, Gearbox, EA and Netflix, all of which have stepped up their indie publishing efforts in recent years.In this marketplace, it\u2019s hard to stand out without a little help.",

ancillary benefits here.And you really love Taylor, some of the weirder tracks on Evermore aside, and you want to share her with the world.It\u2019s terrible concert footage all the way down.I don\u2019t care what fancy things you think you\u2019ve done with the settings.Nobody.You waited in line for two hours.We cannot hear her, and it\u2019s high time somebody let you know.Your videos are terribly lit.But we don\u2019t need to watch a thousand, and I promise that we will not celebrate or heart-react a thousand times.We cannot hear Taylor.I promise.And I think we can reach a compromise.I, personally, treasure the small amount of concert footage that I keep on my phone.He\u2019s good.You\u2019re here, you persevered, and you want the world to know it.Now, imagine the experience when Lady Gaga is in town and everyone I follow is there.You paid good money to be here at the Eras Tour or whatever.Don\u2019t post all three hours to Instagram.Sorry.)Flo Rida does not need to be on your Instagram story.You\u2019re here, you persevered, and you want the world to know it\n\nAlso, you\u2019re spending your Saturday night singing \u201cLove Story\u201d at the top of your lungs in a crowd of thousands of very attractive and well-dressed people, and those loser couch potatoes who follow you on Instagram presumably are not.At any given time, orders of magnitude fewer people will be filming.This will send the message you\u2019re trying to send.That means fewer phones in your way.RelatedTaylor Swift versus Ticketmaster: the latest on the tour that may break up a giant\n\nNow, I can already hear the comments.The urge is human and valid.I understand the temptation.I watch them because they\u2019re a reminder of a time in my life.A time when I was in the same room as an artist I love, hearing them sing songs I love directly to me.No.You fought a relentless battle against Ticketmaster, and dagnabbit, you won.You can make these whatever you want.But I do not watch my concert videos because they are objectively good, entertaining, or interesting.That\u2019s not how Instagram Stories work.The room you are in is very, very dark.Photo by Cindy Ord / Getty Images\n\nFinally, I am going to get a bit philosophical.When you post a picture of your cat rolling over, you\u2019re sharing a moment in your life (and your cat\u2019s life) that does not exist anywhere else in the world.Here\u2019s today\u2019s second unfortunate truth: our concert footage does not have that impact on anyone else.Keep a few valuable, choice videos on your phone.When you attend a concert, you are limited to three Instagram Stories.Everyone at the show will have a better time \u2014 and the footage the rest of us have to watch will look much better, too.There will be three, and we will happily watch three.I was watching a video I took of BTS\u2019s Los Angeles concert just this morning while waiting for the bus.I don\u2019t care, but you get three.Even concerts recorded by professionals with high-quality equipment often don\u2019t sound all that great.You can really enjoy watching the concert that you paid good money for, as opposed to spending the whole time fussing over white balance.I understand that your concert footage has a lot of meaning to you.Not only that, but a future where everyone follows this rule will make concerts better for everyone.However, I am here to bring you an unfortunate but very necessary truth: nobody wants to watch your concert footage.If you\u2019re someone whose Stories I watch often, your story is usually going to be on my front page when I open Instagram and thus one of the first things I habitually click on, and if you\u2019ve posted 937 Blackpink clips to your story, that means you\u2019re subjecting me to videos of frenzied American crowds attempting to scream the Korean lyrics of \u201cShut Down\u201d every time I absentmindedly open the app for the next 24 hours.I\u2019m not going to be one of those people who stands here and insists that you will never watch the videos you take.The artist you are filming looks like a teensy, blurry toy army guy that we would not recognize if you hadn\u2019t tagged them 50 times.You, meanwhile, are recording someone 10,000 miles away from you from the middle of a crowd that is screaming their faces off.When you post an objectively terrible video of Harry Styles singing \u201cFine Line\u201d at Madison Square Garden, you\u2019re posting a video I can find literally anywhere, at any time, on any social platform \u2014 and that I\u2019ve probably also already seen on my feed by virtue of being a person that exists on the internet.You can tag your mom.We will celebrate and heart-react three.They take me back to a once-in-a-lifetime memory, an adrenaline and an environment I may never get to experience again.That\u2019s before we even get into the audio quality.And that is, frankly, not something any of us needs.We just tap your little picture, expecting pictures of your cat, child, dinner, or whatever it is that\u2019s your normal fare because you are someone whose life we are curious about and whose joys we hope to share and celebrate \u2014 and then we are bombarded with a stadium full of AirPods-shattering shrieks.We aren\u2019t told if a story is going to be concert footage before we click on it.RelatedThe concert of the future is already happening in the metaverseApple adds new concert-finding features to Maps and Music\n\nI don\u2019t care how great your phone\u2019s camera is.What better way to achieve these ends than to film the entire concert and post it to your Instagram story?I myself have done this now and again.You are too far back from the stage.But Monica, if you don\u2019t like concert Instagram Stories, just don\u2019t watch them!I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s the truth.You will show the world that you are at a concert and that you are very cool, social, and musical.Look, I understand where you\u2019re coming from.We cannot see anything.That means you don\u2019t have to stand on your toes to see over the iPad Pro the six-foot-five guy in front of you has been brandishing for two hours.",

they\u2019re just casting a wide net and seeing who gets caught in it.This campaign tried to infect people searching for software such as Zoom, Cisco AnyConnect, ChatGPT, and Citrix Workspace.Sophos added that to stay safe, users should always be aware of served advertisements from search engines and use ad-blocking extensions.In many cases, they will even ignore the warnings from their antivirus programs, dismissing them as false positives, due to the fact that they\u2019ve navigated to the page via their trusted search engine.In the campaign, the threat actors were using Google ads and Bing ads to advertise popular tools, such as AnyDesk (a remote desktop tool), WinSCP (SFTP/FTP client for Windows OS), TreeSize Free (free-disk-space manager) and Cisco AnyConnect VPN.This gives the attackers access to the target endpoint and allows them to install second-stage malware, which can be pretty much anything from infostealers, to ransomware.",

            "paraphrased_content": "This power isn\u2019t being wielded by a gadget with a familiar interface like a tablet or laptop though, it\u2019ll be an all-new \u201cspatial computing platform\u201d as Apple is calling it.If your device isn\u2019t compatible you can pick up an optional adapter that might solve the problem, but those can come with their own quirks.While that\u2019s neat I don\u2019t think the Full HD quality experience is worth the typical $400 / \u00a3400 / AU$700 asking price of AR glasses \u2013 ignoring the additional $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$150 or so adapter that\u2019s a required extra to be able to use the glasses with a number of devices.Apple\u2019s Vision Pro has a bigger hill to climb to justify its significantly higher $3,499 price (around \u00a32,800 / AU$5,300).Keep it simple\u00a0Considering that the Vision Pro packs an M2 processor \u2013 the same chipset that powers the iPad Pro (2022) which fills the top spot on our best iPad guide, and a number of the best MacBook and Macs \u2013 we know it\u2019ll be a powerful device.It was never painful but the constant discomfort made it hard to relax while wearing the glasses, and served as a constant distraction when I was using the glasses to work.Other AR glasses like the Xreal Air got around this issue by ensuring that hot components are kept away from your face to avoid similar discomfort, and Meta\u2019s Quest VR headsets went one step further by running underclocked components (meaning that the CPU and GPU were purposefully prevented from running at full power to prevent overheating).The Apple Vision Pro and its external battery (Image credit: Apple)Our tech gets hot when we use it, and that\u2019s no more noticeable than when the heat source is pressed against your face.Nevertheless, Apple will need to make sure the people who shell out on the expensive gadget feel like they got a good deal.This will include nailing the design, putting the headset\u2019s impressive specs to good use by releasing a full suite of exclusive must-have exclusive Vision Pro apps, and ensuring the headset is intuitive to use among other things.The Xreal Air and Beam are impressive, but a bit too pricey (Image credit: Future)We still have a while to wait to see if Apple will stick the landing when the Vision Pro releases to the public in early 2024.As when we\u2019re faced with too many hurdles to jump through just so we can use our new gadget, it\u2019s a lot easier to just box it back up and ask for a refund.2.If you can\u2019t bear wearing it for more than five minutes, no matter how impressive the Vision Pro is it\u2019ll be practically useless.They\u2019re essentially a super portable private second display for your phone, laptop, or games console.Case in point, I recently tested the TCL Nxtwear S glasses and they didn\u2019t handle their heat well at all; after 20 minutes or so the bridge would get uncomfortably warm.Some of these clock restrictions have been loosened to improve the Quest 2 and Quest Pro\u2019s performances, but underclocking is a move Apple may want to consider, because the M2 chip can certainly get toasty.3.While working at TechRadar I\u2019ve covered, tested, and reviewed my fair share of VR headsets and AR smartglasses glasses \u2013 and in this time I\u2019ve picked up on several key factors that can make or break an 'extended reality' gadget like the upcoming Apple Vision Pro.Hot off the heels of my recent TCL Nxtwear S review and updating my Xreal Air review with my thoughts on the Xreal Beam adapter, I\u2019ve been reminded of some potential pitfalls the Vision Pro could be caught out by \u2013 and ways it could avoid them.Here are the top three lessons I hope Apple has learned from other AR glasses so it doesn\u2019t make the same mistakes with the Vision Pro.1.Comfort is keyHaving high performance and being simple to use are certainly two important factors, but even more vital for a gadget you\u2019re expected to wear for an extended period of time is that it\u2019s comfortable.When we think of comfort for VR headsets we instantly think of weight \u2013 something Apple has clearly thought about already with its external battery \u2013 but another factor Apple will need to have considered is heat.The TCL Nxtwear S adapter works fine with my Google Pixel 6 \u2013 but uses a separate app to the glasses that isn\u2019t on the Play Store and setting it up isn\u2019t as straightforward as the instructions make it out to be.This TCL Nxtwear S AR glasses setup is more complex than it looks (Image credit: Future)First, you have to know what your gadget\u2019s hardware specs are to know if it\u2019ll support the glasses, then sometimes you have to download an app that doesn\u2019t work as smoothly as it needs to.It needs to justify its high price\u00a0Lastly, the Apple Vision Pro needs to make sure it justifies its high price tag.As much as I have loved using AR glasses like the Xreal Air and its Xreal Beam adapter, I struggle to recommend them to people because they\u2019re just so darn expensive for what you get.You can\u2019t always just plug them into a device and start using them.But considering it was supposedly in development for several years before its announcement at WWDC 2023 we hope most of the kinks will have been worked out.Apple will need to make sure its Vision Pro is intuitive if it wants to convince people that it\u2019s the future of tech.Meanwhile, the Xreal Beam adapter isn\u2019t compatible with my Pixel 6 at all, but does work with gadgets that the Nxtwear S adapter doesn\u2019t support without needing to use additional adapters.If you\u2019re confused, now you know how I feel.An interface that could be off-putting if Apple isn\u2019t careful.One issue I\u2019ve found with some AR glasses is that they\u2019re not the most simple to use at times.",

            "paraphrased_content": "If nothing else, Microsoft's looming merger with Activision Blizzard (owner of Call of Duty, Diablo and Warcraft, among others)\u00a0will presumably add to that service, as the company's prior acquisition of Bethesda Softworks has.And while a recent price increase has somewhat dented its value, Xbox Game Pass still pairs well with the console if you tend to hop from game to game.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.Still, after a few years on the market, the latest Xbox has built up a fairly diverse lineup of quality titles, with big-budget hits like Forza Horizon 5 joined by smaller-scale gems like Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment\u00a0on our list of the best Xbox games.It has a beefier GPU and more RAM compared to the $300 Xbox Series S, which allows it to more consistently play demanding games at higher resolutions and frame rates.If you're already settled on Xbox, though, this is a good chance to save on the best console Microsoft makes.Microsoft itself has had its share of struggles producing blockbuster exclusives, particularly when compared to Sony's first-party output on the PlayStation 5.As of this writing, the deal appears to be going in and out of stock, so you may need to act quickly.$450 at Dell\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a refresher, the Series X is the higher-performing option in Microsoft's Xbox lineup.Dell offered a similar deal earlier this month, but that didn't come bundled with a game.You still have access to most major third-party titles as well.The Series X also has a disc drive, unlike the all-digital Series S, and it comes with twice as much storage by default at 1TB.That's $50 off the console's usual going rate.If you've been thinking of picking up an Xbox Series X, here's a rare chance to grab Microsoft's console at a discount: Dell is selling a bundle that pairs the device with a copy of the open-world racing game Forza Horizon 5 for $450.Photo by Aaron Souppouris / Engadget\n\n\nXbox Series X + Forza Horizon 5 Bundle\n\n\n$450\n$560\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $110\n                \n            \n\nThis rare discount on Microsoft's top-end Xbox also includes the well-regarded racing game Forza Horizon 5 for no extra cost.We gave the Series X a review score of 87 when it arrived in late 2020.Broadly speaking, the Series X is designed to play games in 4K at 60 fps (though some games can go further), while the Series S is aimed more at 1440p or 1080p displays.Forza Horizon 5, meanwhile, is included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription but typically retails for around $45 on its own (though it's currently available for $30 at Xbox's online store).You still have to use a proprietary card to fully expand that storage, however, and the console itself is much larger than its lower-cost counterpart.Whether you should buy the Xbox Series X over the PS5 largely comes down to how much stock you put in Game Pass, how much PlayStation-exclusive series like God of War, Horizon and Spider-Man appeal to you, and which platform your friends and family use most often.Looking forward, Starfield, the latest RPG from the studio behind The Elder Scrolls and Fallout,\u00a0will arrive in September.",
