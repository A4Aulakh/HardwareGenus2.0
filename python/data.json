            "paraphrased_content": "Today during the big Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival, Phil Spencer strode out onto the stage with FF14 producer Naoki Yoshida to announce the game is coming to Xbox early next year.Needless to say, this is a fairly big turnabout, as exactly the opposite has been true lately.An open beta will launch alongside the game\u2019s 6.5x update, which will likely arrive early in 2023.Since launching a decade ago, Final Fantasy XIV has been a PlayStation console exclusive, an arrangement many never expected to change.The Xbox Series X/S version of Final Fantasy XIV will offer full crossplay, as well as 4K resolution on the Series X.Together with his team, we are bringing the best online experience for this game to Xbox fans everywhere and through crossplay you can experience Final Fantasy XIV with old and new players alike.\"We're very happy to announce the Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV with my friend Yoshida-san here today.According to Yoshi-P, Spencer was heavily involved in bringing Final Fantasy XIV to Xbox, and Spencer himself called this a \u201cseminal moment\u201d in Microsoft\u2019s relationship with Square Enix.\"We see this as a seminal moment in our relationship with you [referring to Yoshida] and the Final Fantasy team as we look to partner more closely together in the future.\"Share this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n TwitterUltimately though, it was Square Enix\u2019s new CEO Takashi Kiryu who made the strongest statement, saying in no uncertain terms that the company is \u201cplanning to bring our games to Xbox\u201d going forward.Here\u2019s what Phil had to say\u2026\n\"It's great to be here with so many Warriors of Light, thank you for the very warm welcome.Interestingly, it seems this will be part of a deeper partnership between Xbox and Square Enix.Some even believed an acquisition by Sony was in the works, but now it seems like that won\u2019t be the case.Well, surprise!Again, Spencer also slipped in that line about the Xbox version of FF14 offering the \u201cbest online experience,\u201d whatever that might mean.The Xbox community is passionate about games, and like so many players around the world, the Final Fantasy series is one that gets lots of love from Team Xbox.Not only have big titles like Final Fantasy XVI been PlayStation exclusive, but even lower profile games were arbitrarily skipping Microsoft\u2019s platform.Final Fantasy XIV arrives on Xbox Series X/S in the spring of 2024.",

video game sales from sites like Xbox, Playstation and Epic Games.$750 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n                        $750 at Best Buy\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lowest price on a MacBook in Apple's current lineup is on the 2020 MacBook Air with the M1 chip, which is down to just $750 at both Amazon and at Best Buy for the 256GB base model.The controls are intuitive, iOS integration is great and the comfortable, behind-the-ear hooks are easy to get in place and stay put (though they can interfere with sunglasses).Headspace\n\n\n\nHeadspace Annual

sale that runs through Saturday.A second-generation Snapdragon 8 chip and support for new gestures round out the new features.It earned a high score of 94 in our review in part thanks to the performance of the M1 chip, which is responsive, launching and running apps effortlessly while conserving the battery life.It comes in a bundle with a copy of the open-world racing game Forza Horizon 5 for a total of $450.Here are the best tech deals from this week that you can still get today.The internal tech is identical to a standard Kindle, with a 300 ppi screen, adjustable front light, 16GB of storage and weeks of battery life.Apple MacBook Air M1\n\n\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar / Engadget\n\n\nApple MacBook Air M1\n\n\n$750\n$999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $249\n                \n            \n\nThis matches the lowest price we've seen for the base model of Apple's M1 MacBook Air.Though, to be fair, this isn't a toy.$80 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kindle Kids ereader is a top pick in our guide to educational toys for kids.We gave them an Engadget score of 86 when they came out in 2019.They'll also ring when you tap a button in the app so you can find your lost keys.Red Dead Redemption 2 is down to $20, for one, while the remasters Mass Effect Legendary Edition and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 are available for $15 and $16, respectively.If you pre-order the foldable on Amazon, you can get a free $200 Amazon Gift Card and a storage upgrade to 512GB.The watch starts at $300 for the 40mm case size and bumps to $330 for the 44mm size.The base configuration of the Z Fold 5 retails for $1,800, which comes with 256GB of storage.It's the budget pick in our MacBook buyer\u2019s guide, and the one we recommend to students or anyone who needs a reliable machine for casual computing.It also recharges quickly and looks nice, something not all charging accessories manage to do.Just remember that they don't offer wireless charging and don't have multipoint connectivity, meaning you can only pair with one device at a time.To help you take advantage of Samsung's new one-click mechanism, Amazon will also include a fabric band to swap out with the included strap.Engadget's Valentina Palladino found it to be a powerful machine that was better than most at navigating around furniture and other objects and despite having excellent suction, it actually moves faster than its cheaper sibling, the j7.Just note that the current generation standard iPad curiously only pairs with the first-gen Apple Pencil.The Volt 276 is one of our top picks in our audio interface guide and we gave it a 90 in our review.It's not even available yet, but Amazon is offering a $200 gift card if you pre-order from its site.Plenty of single items are seeing discounts as well, like the always popular Apple AirPods Pro and the Kids Kindle (which isn't just for kids).$160 at Target\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe named the Powerbeats Pro the most comfortable option in our guide to workout headphones.The 23 percent discount is the steepest discount so far, matching the Prime Day sale price.They're a little older at this point and the over-ear design doesn't block out any noise but they're currently $90 off the MSRP, which is around $40 less than what they've been going for lately and matches their Prime Day sale price on Amazon.Amazon's deal gets you the 512GB model plus a physical gift card shipped separately from the phone.The buds are back down to $249 at both Amazon and directly from Bose.This latest generation has a sharper and brighter display and has an updated processor and larger battery that offers a claimed eight hours of use after just eight minutes of charging.Powerbeats Pro\n\n\n\nPhoto by Billy Steele / Engadget\n\n\nPowerbeats Pro\n\n\n$160\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $90\n                \n            \n\nOne of our favorite sets of buds for working out is a little older at this point, but down to a low price of $160 instead of $250.For ports, you get two Thunderbolt ports, a headphone jack and a MagSafe charging port.Among other announcements, the company officially unveiled its latest foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Z Fold 5.Samsung PRO Plus microSD\n\n\n\nPhoto by Jeff Dunn / Engadget\n\n\nSamsung Pro Plus (128GB)\n\n\n$12\n$19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $7\n                \n            \n\nit's a good time to grab one or a few of Samsung's Pro Plus microSD cards as they're just $12 for the 128GB size.Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II\n\n\n\nPhoto by Billy Steele / Engadget\n\n\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds II\n\n\n$249\n$299\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $50\n                \n            \n\nWhile not an all-time low, this is a $50 discount for the \"best noise cancellation\" pick in our guide to the best wireless earbuds.Non-PS exclusives are also on sale, like the time-bending FPS Deathloop ($15), the sci-fi RPG Cyberpunk 2077 ($25) and one of our favorite co-ops, It Takes Two ($16).Right now it's down to $89 at Amazon, Target and Walmart, which is the same low it hit during Amazon's Prime Day sale.$600 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung's 32-inch M8 Smart Monitor is part computer monitor and part smart TV, meaning it can do everything a monitor can do when hooked up to a PC, but you may never need to do that.This deal has already gone out of stock once, so you may want to jump now if you're interested.Apple Pencil\n\n\n\nPhoto by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget\n\n\nApple Pencil (2nd Gen)\n\n\n$89\n$129\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $40\n                \n            \n\nThe Apple Pencil is a great accessory for your iPad, and makes drawing and note-taking much more fun and accurate.It usually goes for $120, which is $20 more than the standard Kindle, but the sale is knocking it down to just $80, making it a good buy for a kid or even a full-grown adult who enjoys saving money.Elsewhere, the action-game-meets-delivery-sim Death Stranding: Director's Cut is on sale for $20, and Dead Island 2, the zombie action-RPG that was released in April, is available for $45.The folks at Amazon are hoping you'll pre-order the handset from them \u2014 and are offering a $200 Amazon gift card plus a storage upgrade if you do so.The buds have one of the best transparency modes of all the buds we've tried, and we think they're the best pick for people who use iPhones.That's not quite an all time low, as it went for $10 less during last year's Black Friday deals and the most recent Prime Day sale, but is still a tidy discount.$30 at PlayStation\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayStation's Summer Sale is discounting exclusives like Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart ($40 off) and Horizon Forbidden West ($30 off).That's a price they've hit many times before, but matches their all time low.Epic Games Store Summer Sale\n\n\n\nRockstar Games\n\n\nRed Dead Redemption (PC)\n\n\n$20\n$60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $40\n                \n            \n\nThis $40 discount comes as part of the Epic Games Store's latest Summer Sale.If you pre-order the Galaxy Watch 6 from Amazon, the company will throw in a $50 Amazon gift card.$300 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung also revealed two new wearables during Unpacked.We like the Deco XE75 because the WiFi 6E routers support all three wireless bands (including the 6GHz band) and offers a great mix of power, user-friendliness and affordability \u2014 particularly when it's discounted.There's far more content than any typical person will get through and new sessions are added continuously.TP-Link Deco AXE5400 Tri-Band WiFi 6E Mesh System\n\n\n\nBest for most people\n\n\nPhoto by Daniel Cooper / Engadget\n\n\nTP-Link Deco AXE5400 WiFi 6E Mesh System (Deco XE75)\n\n\n$330\n$400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $70\n                \n            \n\nWe think this mesh WiFi system balances power with ease of use and right now the set is 27 percent off.Of all the finding networks out there, Apple's FindMy is by far the most comprehensive as it uses every iPhone in an area (unless the owner has opted out) to ping nearby AirTags and help find them when they're lost.Not all of the discounts are best-ever prices, and the steepest savings are typically reserved for older titles, but a decent selection of games we like are on sale right now, such as Halo: The Master Chief Collection\u00a0($10 off), Star Wars Jedi: Survivor ($17 off) and Elden Ring\u00a0($18 off).It can also act as your smart home display to control your smart devices and keep tabs on your connected cams and doorbells.That brings the studio pack down to $299, which is the usual price of the interface on its own, which means you're getting the included Volt condenser mic and Volt headphones for free.$30 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few different Kasa smart plugs are currently on sale at Amazon, including the Kasa KP125M, which is our pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our guide to smart plugs.$1,800 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Samsung announced its latest flagship foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 during its Unpacked event.The top pick from our guide, TP-Link\u2019s Deco XE75, is currently down to $330 for the three-pack instead of its usual $400.$10 at Xbox\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo game companies and retailers often celebrate the summer months with some sort of sale on popular titles \u2014 maybe because gaming indoors beats heat-fusing to the pavement outside.If you've got a camera, tablet or gaming handheld that could use more space, this is a good time to grab some extra storage.$199 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest generation AirPods Pro are back to their all-time low price of $199.Engadget's Sam Rutherford spent some time with the new foldable recently.$89 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n                        $89 at Target\n                \n\n\n                        $89 at Walmart\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a recent model of an iPad Air, Mini or Pro and have been considering adding a stylus to your setup, you may want to consider grabbing the second-gen Apple Pencil while its on sale for $89.But now you can get it from Walmart or target as well as from Amazon.If you take a minute out of your day and cue up a breathing exercise or guided meditation you may very well find that your shoulders release back down from up around your ears.The bank packs enough charge to fill a late-model iPhone or a Galaxy S-series twice, with a little left over.$20 at Epic Games\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't play on a console, you can still save on some good PC titles with the sale at Epic Games.But the kids version throws in a colorful case and includes a year of Amazon Kids+, a subscription that grants access to thousands of kid-appropriate books and hundreds of audiobooks.Usually $40 for a two-pack, the sale drops it to $30 after a discount and a clickable coupon.The Flex is compact, but manages to give bright, dynamic sound and offers a surprising amount of bass for its size.The self-emptying base means less involvement from you and the setup only takes a few minutes so it can quickly get to work making your floors cleaner.Apple Air Tags (4-pack)\n\n\n\nEngadget\n\n\nApple AirTag 4 Pack\n\n\n$85\n$99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $14\n                \n            \n\nGrab four Apple AirTags for $85, one of the lowest prices we've seen.This week, the biggest event in tech took place in Seoul with Samsung's Unpacked showcase.That's a 40 percent discount and matches the sale price from Prime Day.$129 at Adorama\n                \n\n\n\n                        $130 at Target\n                \n\n\n                        $129 at Bose\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of our top Bluetooth speakers, the Bose SoundLink Flex, is down to $129 at Adoramam, Target and directly from Bose right now.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.$36 at Otterbox\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe often recommend products from Otterbox in our guides and from now through July 29th, the site is running a site-wide, 20 percent off sale.Engadget's Terrance O'Brian appreciates its all-analog emulation of \"one of the most iconic compressors of all time\" and said most other interfaces at this price point can't match the 276's stylish and ergonomic design.All on its own, it can stream Netflix, Disney+, Peacock and other services just by connecting to your WiFi.$85 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n                        $85 at Walmart\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend Apple's AirTag Bluetooth trackers to iPhone users in our guide to those devices.Nintendo has the fast-paced first-person shooter (but with cards for weapons) Neon White for 30 percent off and the rollerblading, '70s drenched shooter, Rollerdrome is half price at Steam.$249 at Amazon\n                \n\n\n\n                        $249 at B&H Photo\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe think the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II offer the best noise cancellation you can buy and recommend them in our guide.The offer only applies to the Bluetooth models,  not the LTE or Watch 6 Classic variants.The game usually retails for $45 on its own.They pair quickly with other Apple devices and make great use of Siri for hands-free commands.Dell is offering a $50 discount on the Xbox Series X, though we don't expect that deal to stick around long.A good battery life and a wireless charging case are just two more points in the buds' favor.Right now a four-pack is down to $85 at Amazon, which is the lowest price we've tracked.A few deals worth calling out include the Novation Summit synth for $460 off of $2,300 and Universal Audio's Volt 276 studio pack for $130 off of $429.Outside of Epic's sale, two more of our favorite games from 2022 are discounted.Of course, many sale items are also available with an Xbox Game Pass subscription, so if you already subscribe, check that availability first.It's currently $38 for a four-pack after a 24 percent discount.Even if you don't care about racing, this may be a good time to buy, considering the Xbox Series X console (or its cheaper, digital-only Series S sibling) will be a required purchase for the upcoming Bethesda game Starfield, unless you plan to play on a PC.Apple MacBook Air M2\n\n\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar / Engadget\n\n\nApple MacBook Air M2\n\n\n$999\n$1,099\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $100\n                \n            \n\nThis a $100 discount on Apple's most recent 13-inch MacBook Air.Other site-wide sales include 20 percent off at Otterbox and a sale on music equipment at Reverb.The 15,000mAh capacity model usually goes for $45, but is $36 after the discount.Kindle Kids\n\n\n\nAmazon\n\n\nKindle Kids (2022)\n\n\n$80\n$120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save $40\n                \n            \n\nTake 33 percent off of the Amazon Kindle Kids e-reader in a deal that matches its Prime Day low price.That matches the lowest price we've seen, including what it went for during Amazon's Prime Day.The Pencil makes drawing and hand-writing on your tablet easier and it even magnetically attaches and charges to the side of compatible devices.Engadget's Cherlynn Low had a chance to check out the watch during a hands on event and you can check out her thoughts here.$49 at Headspace\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've recommended Headspace a few times in our guides because it's an intuitive app that can actually help you relax.The most notable upgrade from last year's model is Samsung's new Flex Hinge, which eliminates most of the gap between the two screen halves when folded.$450 at Dell\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been tough to find the new Xbox console in stock, let alone at a discount, but right now the Xbox Series X is $50 off at Dell.Xbox Series X\n\n\n\nPhoto by Aaron Souppouris /

              \n            \n\nThis half-off deal on Sony's highly-rated action-RPG is one of several deals included in the PlayStation Summer Sale, which kicked off this week.That matches the price it hit during Amazon's recent sale.Right now Xbox is hosting an Ultimate Game Sale with deals up to 80 percent off.You can read our full review here.That's the same as they went for during Amazon's Prime Day.It offers nearly the best sequential write performance of the cards we tested and bested all cards for for random read/write speeds.We gave the ultraportable an impressive 96 in our review, calling it a \u201cnear-perfect Mac.\u201d It has a Liquid Retina display, a quad speaker array and a battery that lasted over 16 hours in our video tests.The PS5 remake of the original The Last of Us is on sale for $50, while the well-reviewed puzzler Humanity is $24.Quick Overview\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)\n\n$199\n$249\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

            "paraphrased_content": "So it feels like Team Red is squandering a real chance to push Team Blue\u2019s hold on the processor market.And this isn\u2019t the only time AMD has done this either.And back in 2022, the tech giant launched the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D but it was produced in low volume and was the only 5000-series chip to sport the extra cache until 2023.And that's a shame as this is probably the best mobile chip ever, and the first one to use the excellent 3D V-Cache technology.It\u2019s similar to the Ryzen 9 7945HX except that, according to PC Gamer, it has the full 64MB of L3 cache bonded on top of one of its eight-core chiplets.It seems that the rumor mill was right about AMD\u2019s latest mobile gaming processor, as the tech giant officially announced the AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX3D.But there\u2019s a catch.The only caveat is that this processor will be available for a single laptop, the Asus ROG Strix Scar 17 X3D.It really seems that AMD\u2019s Dragon Range series could be one of the best AMD processors and even one of the best processors in general.Previously it released the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X3D processor in limited supply only at Micro Center, which was a baffling decision to say the least.It also has the same TDP and the same peak 5.4GHz clock speed, if the chiplet doesn\u2019t have the extra L3 of course.According to AMD, the Ryzen 9 7945HX3D\u2019s full specs are as follows: Zen 4 architecture, 16 cores and 32 threads, L2 cache of 16GB and L3 cache of 128GB, TDP between 55 and 75W, and an AMD Radeon 610M GPU.The AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX3D processor will be launching on August 22nd, 2023, which is just after Gamescom.AMD is wasting a great opportunity\u00a0Considering how incredible the 3D V-Cache technology is, as it manages to get extra performance out of a chip without having to bump up the amount of energy or cooling that chip would normally need, it\u2019s a shame that only one laptop will get to benefit from it.Especially since this tech is ideal for portable machines, as it allows some of the best gaming laptops to get great performance without having to risk additional ventilation issues.And this chip is even more valuable to AMD because it could give both the Intel Raptor Lake-HX and the upcoming 14th-gen CPU refresh a run for the money.",

they\u2019re fun to use but they have no obvious editable options.By default you have no \u2018Style\u2019 set, giving the AI free reign over what to produce, but you can narrow down the outcome to Photo, Art, Digital, 3D or Scene if you like, and also choose from one of the displayed keywords.The most interesting option which caught our eye was \u2018Zoom out\u2019, available on every thumbnail.Think of it as a simplified version of Photoshop - a Photoshop alternative that uses templates to get you started fast.There are also a series of online companion apps, available under the banner Creative Flow+.Which leads us to the last two which we\u2019ll look at in greater detail below: \u2018Generate\u2019 and \u2018Create\u2019.Getting started: 3/5\u00a0Creative Flow+: GenerateGenerate isn\u2019t technically part of Creative Flow+ since you have to pay for the results you wish to use, but it\u2019s an AI creation tool which can be added to your workflow\u00a0 (Image credit: Shutterstock)AI comes to Shutterstock, with varying degrees of success, but its output isn\u2019t part of your Creative Flow+ subscription\u00a0AI is everywhere - and that includes Creative Flow+.Creative Flow+: Pricing & plansA service that\u2019s included in Shutterstock subscriptions, available as a standalone product with a free trial\u00a0Creative Flow+ is a standalone subscription, independent of the rest of Shutterstock\u2019s offerings.But to be honest, aside from setting the right aspect ratio for your project, it\u2019s hard to discern what the templates on offer have that the templates available in Create don\u2019t.For starters, although it\u2019s perfectly possible, you don\u2019t need to upload your own media to Create, but have thousands of photos to choose from -

            "paraphrased_content": "In this marketplace, it\u2019s hard to stand out without a little help.The streaming company officially entered the game-distribution business in 2021, and it\u2019s on track to have 100 titles in its library by the end of 2023, all freely available to anyone with a Netflix subscription.With Netflix\u2019s resources, the Night School team was able to add day-one support for 32 languages in Oxenfree II, and they were able to fly in remote collaborators as needed.It\u2019s this fantasy world with no currency, even, and all that\u2019s intentional.For the moment, this shift is powering a small but highly visible boom in the world of indie games.And then there\u2019s Netflix.\u201cAnd now in the last few years, literally, it's non-stop.\u201d\nThe acquisition allowed Night School to move into the Netflix offices and it provided stability for the studio overall, Krankel said.So much money that outside companies are popping up and trying to get a piece of the pie \u2014 and for now, it\u2019s created a shiny bubble of pretty PR packages and bespoke showcases dedicated to small teams and their games.Ruiz did contract work for a while after Aztez, and in 2018 he pitched Bounty Star to people he knew at Annapurna.As the creative director, I didn't want any of that stuff.\u201cAll that's really exciting,\u201d Oxenfree II lead developer Bryant Cannon said just ahead of the game\u2019s July 12th release.This system has already distributed innovative and important games to huge audiences \u2014 Tchia, Tunic, Sea of Solitude, Gris \u2014 and it\u2019s offered stability to a lot of independent artists.There were 309 games added to Steam in 2010; in 2017, there were 6,306.He began working on Aztez in 2010, when Steam was a curated marketplace where Valve employees hand-selected individual games for the platform.\u201cYou'll notice real quick that the game that you've been playing can't be free-to-play,\u201d Medeiros told Engadget in April.There\u2019s also Humble, Private Division, Raw Fury, Epic Games, Finji, Gearbox, EA and Netflix, all of which have stepped up their indie publishing efforts in recent years.You don't have to do that stuff.Devolver Digital is the granddaddy of indie publishers, and since 2009 it\u2019s released hits including Hotline Miami, Hatoful Boyfriend, The Talos Principle, Gris, Fall Guys, Inscryption, Weird West and Cult of the Lamb, all in collaboration with small development teams.Like, for instance, Ben Ruiz.Like, they're not averse to scale.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just Annapurna making these types of deals with indies nowadays.Its showcases are now a staple of the gaming calendar.For now, it\u2019s a functional system, even if it ultimately leaves publishers, rather than independent developers, with most of the power.Simogo\u2019s latest projects, Sayonara Wild Hearts and Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, are the result of its partnership with Annapurna.The distribution process for indie developers has shifted over the past few years from a self-publishing-first model, to one that prioritizes deal-making and acquisitions.He founded two studios, he did contract work on titles including Super Meat Boy and Overland, and he independently published a tentpole original project, the monochromatic brawler Aztez.Sayonara Wild HeartsAnnapurna Interactive\n\u201cI think for us as a studio, the biggest change is working with a publisher, something which we would see as completely uninteresting and impractical ten years ago,\u201d Simogo co-founder Simor Flesser told Engadget earlier this month.The first of these purchases was Night School, which Netflix acquired in 2021.Amid the ongoing writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strike, the company is facing accusations that it instituted wildly unfair compensation deals for creatives, paying out one-time, minimal wages even as projects became massive hits on the streaming service.Bounty Star is being published by Annapurna Interactive and it\u2019s due out in early 2024.The game has a complex premise \u2014 it stars Clem, a desert bounty hunter with plenty of baggage, and it involves mech battles, emotional narrative scenes and home-management mechanics, including some light gardening.Meanwhile, Microsoft\u2019s strategy is to simply acquire the studios it likes, and today it has 23 developers under the Xbox Game Studios banner.Because I mean, I liked games before all that stuff happened.Annapurna bit, and Ruiz landed a publishing deal.\u201cLike, where would the ads go?Sony is taking a similar approach, though it owns fewer studios than Microsoft.It was founded in 2016 as an offshoot of Annapurna Pictures and quickly established its brand as an arthouse publisher, focused on visually innovative and emotionally driven experiences.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re just trying to grab a thing that will make money or collaborate with people that are just going to make them money.There are more than 90,000 games on Steam today; Xbox Game Pass and PS Plus Premium libraries each have more than 400 titles (and counting).Nowadays, Ruiz is running a five-person studio called Dinogod and he\u2019s building Bounty Star, a game that blends mech combat with life-sim mechanics.\u201cConsolidation \u2014 I didn't really have my finger as much on the pulse of that, because when we joined Netflix, it didn't feel like that was happening so rapidly,\u201d Night School co-founder Sean Krankel told Engadget.There are two big benefits of working with Netflix, according to Snowman creative director Jason Medeiros: The instant access to an audience of more than 230 million people, and the freedom to build a game without worrying about monetization.For now, bespoke publishing is the name of the indie game.\u201cWhen everything was greenlit, that was the first step, to bring in these five or six people\u2026.\u201cThe fact that Dinogod has five full time people, that was a part of the partnership,\u201d Ruiz said.Even established studios, such as Device 6 creator Simogo, have swapped to a publisher-first model.Ruiz and his business partner built Aztez in between contract projects, and by the time it was ready to debut on Steam in 2017, the indie market was saturated.\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but without help, I just don't know how anyone's doing it \u2026 I got a lot of friends in the same boat.\u201d\nRuiz\u2019s career is a microcosm of the shifting landscape for indie developers over the past 10 years.GrisDevolver Digital\nIt\u2019s difficult to ignore the potential for exploitation down the line, especially with Netflix in the mix.Annapurna is handling the marketing for Bounty Star, and it\u2019s also financially supporting Ruiz\u2019s studio, Dinogod.It's a breath of fresh air; we jump on opportunities to make games that way.\u201d\nOf course, there are still developers self-publishing their projects \u2014 Vampire Survivors, Phasmophobia, Celeste and Among Us are all standout examples \u2014 but there\u2019s a murkier path to success with this model, one based on timing, trends and a hefty amount of luck.Microsoft and Sony are also signing hundreds of one-off deals with indies as they attempt to fill their streaming libraries \u2014 Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus Premium \u2014 with a steady stream of new experiences.It\u2019s taken 10 years to get here, but it\u2019s now a solid, quantifiable fact: There\u2019s a lot of money in indie games.It shifted to a community-voting approach called Greenlight, before eventually landing on the everything-goes Early Access model we know today.This system had fully imploded by 2012: On the heels of breakout hits like Braid, Super Meat Boy and Fez, the indie market was overrun by new games and developers, and Steam dropped its curation efforts.For anyone with an eye on video game news, it\u2019s been hard to ignore the recent rise of names like Annapurna Interactive, Devolver Digital, Private Division, Humble, Epic Games and Netflix tied to independent projects.Annapurna, for its part, was accused of mishandling claims of abuse at three prominent studios on its publishing roster \u2014 Mountains, Funomena and Fullbright \u2014 in a March 2022 documentary by People Make Games.Bounty StarAnnapurna Interactive\n\u201cEverything favors a publisher relationship, seemingly, because self-publishing has become this extraordinarily difficult thing,\u201d Ruiz said.\u201cI hope Annapurna\u2019s success means more Annapurnas in the future,\u201d Ruiz said.Meanwhile, the current consolidation craze is shrinking the video game industry overall, even as the market caps of the biggest companies continue to rise.This is the new standard for indie developers: Identify the publisher that best matches your game\u2019s tone, pitch it, and pray.It\u2019s already brought a number of high-profile titles to mobile devices, including Kentucky Route Zero, Poinpy, Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, Lucky Luna and Oxenfree II, and it\u2019s purchased a few studios outright \u2014 notably, Alphabear developer Spry Fox and Oxenfree house Night School Studio.\u201cI don't think I ever want to self-publish again.\u201d\nBen Ruiz has been a game developer since 2005, and in that time, he\u2019s pretty much done it all.If [Annapurna is] into a thing that they think is a good move, and it needs more people, that seems to be fully okay.They clearly have a brand and an aesthetic directive \u2026 if I can keep making games for them for a long time, I will.\u201d\nThe new normal works for Ruiz \u2014 and Flesser, Krankel, Medeiros and plenty of others.So having a platform like Netflix, it's just like, none of that matters.Even with a hefty amount of hype behind it, Aztez had trouble standing out, and that was the last time Ruiz tried self-publishing.Snowman is best known as the name behind Alto\u2019s Adventure and Alto\u2019s Odyssey, and its latest project is Laya\u2019s Horizon, a serene wingsuit experience exclusive to Netflix.When Ruiz pitched the game, he was clear that he\u2019d need a team of five or six people to bring his vision to life, and Annapurna gave him the funding to hire up.StrayAnnapurna Interactive\nAnnapurna Interactive is one of the most prominent publishers of indie games today, with titles like Stray, Outer Wilds, Neon White, Donut County and What Remains of Edith Finch on its books.\u201cI think the game is going to be better because we have this battery in our back.\u201d\nOxenfree IINetflix\nOutside of acquisitions, Netflix is also signing individual deals with developers.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Perhaps the most startling revelation was the report that studios offered a \u201cgroundbreaking AI proposal\u201d to pay performers for one day of work to use their digital likeness for eternity.HBO\u2019s Succession leads this year\u2019s field with 27 nominations, while The Last of Us made history with an impressive 24 nods for the video game adaptation.Ted Lasso is up for Best Comedy Series among its 21 nominations, which also include Best Actor in a Comedy Series for lead Jason Sudeikis, Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy for Hannah Waddingham and Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy for Phil Dunster.Apple\u2019s mesmerizing sci-fi adaptation Silo debuted too late for consideration this year, but don\u2019t be shocked if it features prominently in the 2024 list.Artificial intelligence figures prominently in both cases: Scribes and performers fear producers will increasingly use AI-generated content to diminish humans\u2019 ability to make a living in the already-brutal show business industry.Elsewhere, Amazon\u2019s colossally ambitious The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power received six nods (mostly in technical categories).Apple\nApple TV+ also fared well in nominations, with 52.HBO led all platforms with 127 nods, while Netflix led streaming-only networks with 103, followed by Apple (52) and Amazon (46).The Primetime Emmys won\u2019t take place on September 18th, according to Variety.The TV Academy hasn\u2019t yet announced a replacement date, but Variety previously reported that broadcast partner Fox tentatively wants to shoot for January 2024.Netflix\u2019s Stranger Things picked up six, Peacock\u2019s Poker Face nabbed four and Star Trek: Picard got two makeup nominations.In addition to The Last of Us and Andor, Outstanding Drama Series nominees include Better Call Saul, House of the Dragon, Succession, The White Lotus and Yellowjackets.Obi-Wan Kenobi, also on Disney+, received five more nominations, including Best Limited or Anthology Series.Hollywood writers began striking in early May, while actors joined them earlier this month.Disney / Lucasfilm\nAlthough The Last of Us marked a milestone for gaming adaptations (including acting nominations for Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey), season three of Disney\u2019s The Mandalorian received an impressive nine nominations.The publication reported on Thursday that vendors scheduled to work the event have been told the ceremony is delayed because of the writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes that have shut down all Hollywood productions and promotions.As generative AI advances quicker than most people could have imagined, it now threatens to annihilate content creators\u2019 careers inside and outside of Hollywood.It recounts the journey of spy Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), one of the fallen heroes of 2016\u2019s Rogue One, in the period building up to the Rebel Alliance\u2019s rise against the Galactic Empire.At the same time, Andor picked up eight nods \u2014 including Outstanding Drama Series.",

            "paraphrased_content": "When you post a picture of your cat rolling over, you\u2019re sharing a moment in your life (and your cat\u2019s life) that does not exist anywhere else in the world.Your arms will be so grateful.We cannot see anything.That means you don\u2019t have to stand on your toes to see over the iPad Pro the six-foot-five guy in front of you has been brandishing for two hours.You waited in line for two hours.At any given time, orders of magnitude fewer people will be filming.You can make these whatever you want.Everyone at the show will have a better time \u2014 and the footage the rest of us have to watch will look much better, too.Your videos are terribly lit.Here\u2019s today\u2019s second unfortunate truth: our concert footage does not have that impact on anyone else.When you attend a concert, you are limited to three Instagram Stories.We cannot hear her, and it\u2019s high time somebody let you know.No.We aren\u2019t told if a story is going to be concert footage before we click on it.Look, I understand where you\u2019re coming from.I understand the temptation.(In fact, they are probably worse.And you really love Taylor, some of the weirder tracks on Evermore aside, and you want to share her with the world.You paid good money to be here at the Eras Tour or whatever.What better way to achieve these ends than to film the entire concert and post it to your Instagram story?And I think we can reach a compromise.It\u2019s terrible concert footage all the way down.We cannot hear Taylor.Flo Rida does not need to be on your Instagram story.Sorry.)You\u2019re here, you persevered, and you want the world to know it\n\nAlso, you\u2019re spending your Saturday night singing \u201cLove Story\u201d at the top of your lungs in a crowd of thousands of very attractive and well-dressed people, and those loser couch potatoes who follow you on Instagram presumably are not.That means fewer phones in your way.But Monica, if you don\u2019t like concert Instagram Stories, just don\u2019t watch them!They take me back to a once-in-a-lifetime memory, an adrenaline and an environment I may never get to experience again.I don\u2019t care, but you get three.Keep a few valuable, choice videos on your phone.A time when I was in the same room as an artist I love, hearing them sing songs I love directly to me.That\u2019s not how Instagram Stories work.You\u2019re here, you persevered, and you want the world to know it.I promise.You fought a relentless battle against Ticketmaster, and dagnabbit, you won.The artist you are filming looks like a teensy, blurry toy army guy that we would not recognize if you hadn\u2019t tagged them 50 times.If you\u2019re someone whose Stories I watch often, your story is usually going to be on my front page when I open Instagram and thus one of the first things I habitually click on, and if you\u2019ve posted 937 Blackpink clips to your story, that means you\u2019re subjecting me to videos of frenzied American crowds attempting to scream the Korean lyrics of \u201cShut Down\u201d every time I absentmindedly open the app for the next 24 hours.I\u2019m not going to be one of those people who stands here and insists that you will never watch the videos you take.You will show the world that you are at a concert and that you are very cool, social, and musical.I was watching a video I took of BTS\u2019s Los Angeles concert just this morning while waiting for the bus.Don\u2019t post all three hours to Instagram.This will send the message you\u2019re trying to send.There will be three, and we will happily watch three.Here\u2019s what I propose.Photo by Cindy Ord / Getty Images\n\nFinally, I am going to get a bit philosophical.You sat in ridiculous traffic.And that is, frankly, not something any of us needs.You, meanwhile, are recording someone 10,000 miles away from you from the middle of a crowd that is screaming their faces off.I, personally, treasure the small amount of concert footage that I keep on my phone.You can really enjoy watching the concert that you paid good money for, as opposed to spending the whole time fussing over white balance.Trust me.RelatedThe concert of the future is already happening in the metaverseApple adds new concert-finding features to Maps and Music\n\nI don\u2019t care how great your phone\u2019s camera is.You can tag your mom.Even concerts recorded by professionals with high-quality equipment often don\u2019t sound all that great.We just tap your little picture, expecting pictures of your cat, child, dinner, or whatever it is that\u2019s your normal fare because you are someone whose life we are curious about and whose joys we hope to share and celebrate \u2014 and then we are bombarded with a stadium full of AirPods-shattering shrieks.You promised your mom that you\u2019d get out of the house more, and you\u2019d like her to know you\u2019re keeping your word.I understand that your concert footage has a lot of meaning to you.The urge is human and valid.It\u2019s concert footage all the way down\n\nBut again, I understand.RelatedTaylor Swift versus Ticketmaster: the latest on the tour that may break up a giant\n\nNow, I can already hear the comments.I don\u2019t care what fancy things you think you\u2019ve done with the settings.We will celebrate and heart-react three.Not only that, but a future where everyone follows this rule will make concerts better for everyone.However, I am here to bring you an unfortunate but very necessary truth: nobody wants to watch your concert footage.When you post an objectively terrible video of Harry Styles singing \u201cFine Line\u201d at Madison Square Garden, you\u2019re posting a video I can find literally anywhere, at any time, on any social platform \u2014 and that I\u2019ve probably also already seen on my feed by virtue of being a person that exists on the internet.You can tag the artist.But we don\u2019t need to watch a thousand, and I promise that we will not celebrate or heart-react a thousand times.You were up all night selecting your outfit.Nobody.You are too far back from the stage.Once you\u2019ve filmed your three, you can put your phone down.He\u2019s good.I watch them because they\u2019re a reminder of a time in my life.That\u2019s before we even get into the audio quality.You can tag Tim Cook.I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s the truth.I myself have done this now and again.But I do not watch my concert videos because they are objectively good, entertaining, or interesting.The room you are in is very, very dark.There are all kinds of ancillary benefits here.They take me back to the roar of the crowd, the heat of the fireworks, the plastic smell of the stadium seats.Now, imagine the experience when Lady Gaga is in town and everyone I follow is there.For someone who wasn\u2019t there with us, our videos are identical to literally any video of this same concert that exists on YouTube or TikTok.",

they\u2019re just casting a wide net and seeing who gets caught in it.With trust at such a high level, many people don\u2019t look twice when clicking on the search engine result spot reserved for paid advertising and don\u2019t double-check the address bar of the website they\u2019ve just opened.As a result, it\u2019s the victims who end up compromising their own devices.Finally, users should consider restricting the capability to mount virtual file systems via Group Policy Objects, and be aware of downloading \u201cabnormal\u201d file extensions.Go deeperIf you want to learn more, start by checking out our guide for the best endpoint protection, as well as best firewalls.",

after 20 minutes or so the bridge would get uncomfortably warm.Meanwhile, the Xreal Beam adapter isn\u2019t compatible with my Pixel 6 at all, but does work with gadgets that the Nxtwear S adapter doesn\u2019t support without needing to use additional adapters.If you\u2019re confused, now you know how I feel.If your device isn\u2019t compatible you can pick up an optional adapter that might solve the problem, but those can come with their own quirks.They\u2019re essentially a super portable private second display for your phone, laptop, or games console.It needs to justify its high price\u00a0Lastly, the Apple Vision Pro needs to make sure it justifies its high price tag.As much as I have loved using AR glasses like the Xreal Air and its Xreal Beam adapter, I struggle to recommend them to people because they\u2019re just so darn expensive for what you get.While that\u2019s neat I don\u2019t think the Full HD quality experience is worth the typical $400 / \u00a3400 / AU$700 asking price of AR glasses \u2013 ignoring the additional $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$150 or so adapter that\u2019s a required extra to be able to use the glasses with a number of devices.Apple\u2019s Vision Pro has a bigger hill to climb to justify its significantly higher $3,499 price (around \u00a32,800 / AU$5,300).This will include nailing the design, putting the headset\u2019s impressive specs to good use by releasing a full suite of exclusive must-have exclusive Vision Pro apps, and ensuring the headset is intuitive to use among other things.The Xreal Air and Beam are impressive, but a bit too pricey (Image credit: Future)We still have a while to wait to see if Apple will stick the landing when the Vision Pro releases to the public in early 2024.The TCL Nxtwear S adapter works fine with my Google Pixel 6 \u2013 but uses a separate app to the glasses that isn\u2019t on the Play Store and setting it up isn\u2019t as straightforward as the instructions make it out to be.It was never painful but the constant discomfort made it hard to relax while wearing the glasses, and served as a constant distraction when I was using the glasses to work.Other AR glasses like the Xreal Air got around this issue by ensuring that hot components are kept away from your face to avoid similar discomfort, and Meta\u2019s Quest VR headsets went one step further by running underclocked components (meaning that the CPU and GPU were purposefully prevented from running at full power to prevent overheating).Keep it simple\u00a0Considering that the Vision Pro packs an M2 processor \u2013 the same chipset that powers the iPad Pro (2022) which fills the top spot on our best iPad guide, and a number of the best MacBook and Macs \u2013 we know it\u2019ll be a powerful device.When we think of comfort for VR headsets we instantly think of weight \u2013 something Apple has clearly thought about already with its external battery \u2013 but another factor Apple will need to have considered is heat.While working at TechRadar I\u2019ve covered, tested, and reviewed my fair share of VR headsets and AR smartglasses glasses \u2013 and in this time I\u2019ve picked up on several key factors that can make or break an 'extended reality' gadget like the upcoming Apple Vision Pro.Hot off the heels of my recent TCL Nxtwear S review and updating my Xreal Air review with my thoughts on the Xreal Beam adapter, I\u2019ve been reminded of some potential pitfalls the Vision Pro could be caught out by \u2013 and ways it could avoid them.Here are the top three lessons I hope Apple has learned from other AR glasses so it doesn\u2019t make the same mistakes with the Vision Pro.1.This TCL Nxtwear S AR glasses setup is more complex than it looks (Image credit: Future)First, you have to know what your gadget\u2019s hardware specs are to know if it\u2019ll support the glasses, then sometimes you have to download an app that doesn\u2019t work as smoothly as it needs to.But considering it was supposedly in development for several years before its announcement at WWDC 2023 we hope most of the kinks will have been worked out.",

            "paraphrased_content": "This is a hint that the feature is very much on its way, though, and we don\u2019t see any reason why it wouldn\u2019t come to consumers on Windows 11 eventually.The company has decided on the way forward, picking a single Spotlight experience out of those tested.Microsoft tells us the new Spotlight (shown in the below image) includes \u201cpreviewing images at full screen, multiple opportunities to learn more about each image and a minimized experience.\u201d(Image credit: Microsoft)Elsewhere, there\u2019s a change for the system tray in the taskbar whereby notifications have been switched to a bell icon.As we\u2019ve said in the past, it\u2019s going to be particularly handy for image files, as you can use the preview to check you\u2019re opening the right pic.Microsoft has also done away with the number that shows the tally of notifications queued up for you to peruse.Turning to the Start menu, we see the appearance of something that was previously discovered hidden in the background of Windows 11 \u2013 a rich preview pane that pops up when you hover the cursor over files in the \u2018Recommended\u2019 section.Those glitches have been fixed, so the rollout is once again happening (not everyone will see this yet, as a result).Another interesting tweak is for webcams, with pop-ups now warning you if you\u2019ve accidentally got your privacy shutter closed, or if there are other streaming issues with the camera such as it failing to work.A final one to mention: when deleting a large collection of files and packing them off to the recycle bin, the \u2018calculating\u2019 process that happens has been made speedier, so you won\u2019t have to wait as long overall for the files to be binned.Microsoft\u2019s blog post on build 23511 has the full and rather exhaustive details on the tweaks and additions going on with this preview.Analysis: Moving in the right direction with the interfaceThere are a lot of useful refinements here, and it\u2019s good to see suggestions with Snap Layouts are progressing again.This furnishes extra details such as the file's location, when it was last edited, and a thumbnail image preview in the case of a photo.The catch with these Start menu file previews is that they\u2019re only available to business users right now (those signed into Azure Active Directory or AAD, running Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise).There\u2019s quite a lot going on with build 23511, and some of the other highlights include Microsoft reenabling suggestions for Snap Layouts.Previously this was hidden in the background, as noted, but Microsoft now has the functionality live, which is great \u2013 albeit only for business users.Windows 11 has got a new preview build (yes, another one \u2013 they\u2019re coming fast these days across all the different testing channels) which makes some interesting changes to Windows Spotlight, notifications, and the Start menu (with a caveat in the latter case).All this, and a good deal more, comes packaged in the new build 23511 for the Dev channel.First up, you may recall Microsoft has been experimenting with different ways of implementing Windows Spotlight (images for the lock screen background, which can also be used on the Windows 11 desktop if you wish).These had previously been rolling out but were turned off due to bugs that caused crashes.This is a nifty area of the UI that is underused, and Microsoft is looking to make it a more tempting proposition by providing suggested layouts (templates) for snapping to in a jiffy, and showing icons to indicate which windows will contain what apps in the snapped layout.That bell will be just an outline if there are no notifications pending, and when there are, it will be filled in (with a color based on your system accent color).Neat.The Start menu change is also an interesting one.",

feeling.Although it doesn\u2019t have adjustable fill, the pillow is available in both mid-loft and low-loft versions, so you can select the right loft for your needs.(Image credit: Terri Williams)So, I found the Zamat pillows soft and supportive, but not so much that they gained a place in my regular pillow rotation.The pillow is divided into several sections.\u00a356.07at ZamatsleepThe Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow provides contouring to support the head, neck, shoulders, and arms.However, when I put the covers back on, I was never again able to achieve the neat appearance of the pillow before it was unzipped.The moisture-wicking bamboo and polyester cover keeps the pillow from getting too hot, and helps to keep the pillow clean.All of this combines for quite a supportive and comfortable sleeping experience.(Image credit: Terri Williams)Fortunately, I did not experience any of the off-gassing smells that are sometimes present with compressed bedding.The zippable cover reveals another cover, and under that, the polyurethane foam.Zamat is committed to making sure you know exactly how to use and care for its products.The pillows were shrink wrapped, and after cutting the plastic off, the pillows immediately started expanding.Directly below this area, the cervical extension area holds the head and curve of the neck and makes it easier to breathe smoothly while sleeping.On either side of the cervical extension area for the neck are the cervical extension areas that relieve shoulder pressure.Having said that, if you prefer a mid or low loft pillow, this one is thoughtfully designed to provide support on several levels.It can also be used in a variety of sleep positions.After taking the cover off, it was nearly impossible to get it to fit quite the same when I put it back on the pillow.Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow review: performanceSupports neck, head and armsMoisture wicking cover to stay coolFor over two weeks, I slept on a pair of Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillows to see how they fared in performance, testing for setup, comfort, support, and temperature regulation.(Image credit: Terri

can properly cradle your head.The polyurethane foam is certified by CertiPUR-US, and is free from ozone depleters and Tris flame retardants, as well as formaldehyde, mercury, lead, and other heavy metals.The butterfly design is definitely unique, but functional.It does not have cooling properties.View the Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow from $75.99/Sale $65.99 at Zamat\nThe Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow is also at Amazon for $89.99/Sale $55.99.Instructions were also inside of the box \u2013 and I really like this attention to detail.Beneath it is the ARC cervical support area, which supports and holds the neck at the right angle.I don\u2019t stand around watching pillows decompress, but when I came back into the room, the pillows had reached the desired size.However, when the testing was over, I reverted back to my Saatva Latex Pillows and Sobel Westex Down Pillows \u2013 along with my Purple Harmony Pillow when I\u2019m sideways across the bed watching TV.For example, I\u2019m a combination (side and stomach) sleeper, and my preference is a high loft pillow.During the 2 week test period, I was comfortable sleeping on my side, stomach and even back.Honestly, this was the only problem area that I encountered.The unique design makes it a pillow that can be used by side, back, and stomach sleepers \u2013 if you follow the specific instructions for each.It\u2019s only available in one size (standard), but you can choose between two color choices: solid white, and white with light grey trim.It\u2019s also important to note that while the pillows will fit in standard pillow cases, they look rather awkward since they don\u2019t have the same shape as regular pillows.Temperature regulation\u00a04.5 out of 5 starsThe Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow has a bamboo pillow made of moisture-wicking bamboo and polyester.But that\u2019s because, again, my preference is high loft- squishy soft pillows.Zamat also makes a regular-looking Hyper Shredded Memory Foam Pillow, $119.99/Sale $59.99, which is thick and plush.In addition, the company makes a NekGenic Cervical Traction Neck Pilllow with Magnetic Therapy, which looks like a soft barbell, and sells for $64.99/Sale $59.99Among memory foam pillows, the Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow is in the mid-range, and is often on sale.Although it\u2019s not a cervical pillow, it provides a nice balance between support and moldability.While the pillow itself isn\u2019t washable, the cover can be removed and laundered in the washing machine, making it easy to maintain.I tested the Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow for over two weeks to see how it compares to the rest of the best pillows on the market.(Image credit: Terri Williams)The memory foam is soft and squishy, and also slowly springs back to shape.Many of the reviewers stated that they had chronic pain, and stated that the pillow offered support and relief.However, I was surprised that it did indeed lower the pillow a bit.Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow review: user reviewsThe Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow has 230 reviews on the company\u2019s website with a 4.8 rating.For example, if you\u2019re a side sleeper, the company recommends using the wing side of the pillow, placing your shoulders close to the pillow while placing your arms on one of the armrests to reduce numbness.Back sleepers can use both sides of the pillow (with the option to fold the arms under the wings) and the neck and head support reduces pressure on the posterior skull to reduce snoring and improve sleep.Stomach sleepers are advised to use the wing side of the pillow (and fold the arms under the wings), and relax the shoulders and arms to avoid a stiff neck.It has separate support areas for your head, neck, shoulder, and arms.Purchasing 4 packs will save you $30.The cover is also machine-washable.The DreamCloud Best Rest Memory Foam Pillow is another option to consider.But it does not have adjustable fill.Also, the Casper Hybrid Pillow is made of ultra-soft foam and moldable fiber, so it\u2019s squishy, yet supportive.Since the pillow is so versatile, it can work for side, back, and stomach sleepers.Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow review: design and materialsSeveral cervical support areas keep head and neck alignedArm support area reduces pressure on armsBamboo rayon outer cover is breathableThe Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow has a polyurethane non-temperature foam material and a 100% polyester pillow case.As a cervical pillow, it\u2019s on the slightly higher end.A comparable option is the DreamCloud Best Rest Memory Foam Pillow.However, keep in mind that this is not necessarily a cooling pillow, like, for example, the Nectar Copper Pillow or the\u00a0 Nolah Cooling Foam Pillow.Firmness and support\u00a04.5 out of 5 starsIn my opinion, the level of firmness and support provided by the Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow depends on your sleep preferences.Since I\u2019m not a fan of branded boxes that advertise what\u2019s inside, I was happy to see that contents were not broadcast to everyone in the shipping process.Among negative reviews, some thought the pillow was hard and felt like a rock.Should you buy the Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow?The middle of the pillow is the head support area, which is designed to hold the head at the right angle.I also slept on side, back, and stomach positions to see if the performance was the same.Here\u2019s how I got on...Setup\u00a05 out of 5 starsThe pair of Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillows arrived in boxes covered with black plastic.In theory, all of this should combine for an awesome sleeping experience \u2013 but here\u2019s my problem: I tend not to sleep squarely in the middle of the pillow, so I had to frequently remind myself to move back to the center.And since I switch from sleeping on my side to sleeping on my stomach, I kept having to remind myself to place my hands in the correct position to benefit from the pillow\u2019s arm support design.However, when I remembered to follow the instructions, the pillow was enjoyable to sleep on and I never woke up with aches and pains.Also, I wasn\u2019t sure if removing the 0.8\u201d memory foam at the bottom of the pillow would really make that much of a difference for someone who would find the pillow to be too high.And finally, the arm support areas on either side of the pillow reduce pressure on the arms.When you position your upper body to rest on each specified area \u2013 including the armrests, which are designed to reduce the pressure on your arms and neck, and increase circulation in your cervical spine and body - the pillow does a good job of relieving aches and pains.However, this is best achieved if you follow Zamat\u2019s instructions.Also, if you purchase 2 packs of pillows on the Zamat website, you can save $10.The ARC cervical support area supported and held my neck in the right position, while the cervical extension area gently cradled my head and the curve of the neck.When I slept on my side, there were additional cervical extension areas to help relieve shoulder pressure.However, the Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow is worth a try \u2013 especially if you're struggling to sleep with chronic pain.Today's best Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow

cavity for a more immersive sleep experience.In the photos, you can clearly tell which pillow had been unzipped and which one hadn\u2019t been touched.I slept cool throughout the test period.However, I did sleep under a luxe faux fur throw for warmth.The pillow includes a central sleep area to lay your head, an ARC cervical support area for your neck, a shoulder contour area, and also an arm support area.Among negative comments, some reviewers complained that they needed to purchase an insert, thought the pillow wasn\u2019t firm enough, or thought it was hot.On Amazon, the pillow has 8,034 ratings with a 4.4 star average.However, you need to make sure you\u2019re sleeping in the right parts of the pillow to get these benefits.It retails for $85.99/Sale $69.99.But if you want a thicker pillow, you\u2019ll need to purchase inserts separately.Also, I\u2019m not sure if adding or removing such a thin piece of memory foam is going to make that much of a difference.Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow review: price and dealsZamat makes three regular (although still oddly-shaped) pillows.Positive reviews included those who said it exceeded expectations, and was comfortable for their neck and shoulders.(Granted, I also tested the pillows during a cooler season \u2013 and with the HVAC set low.)The memory foam is springy and bounces back to its original shape \u2013 and the fact that the pillow is curved also makes it more ergonomic than many other options.The Original Cervical Pillow with Contour Design, which sells for $$75.99/Sale $65.99, lacks the butterfly design.The pillow also has cooling properties.Zamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillow review in briefZamat Butterfly Shaped Cervical Memory Foam Pillowat a glanceType:

            "paraphrased_content": "Sign up here.At the same time, it seems clear that the design of Facebook does influence what people see, and may shift their beliefs over time.These studies cover a relatively short period \u2014 during which, I would note, the company had enacted \u201cbreak the glass\u201d measures designed to show people higher-quality news \u2014 and even still there was cause for concern.\u201cParticipants didn\u2019t differ from other users in how polarized their views were on issues like immigration, COVID-19 restrictions, or racial discrimination, for example, or in their knowledge about the elections, their trust in media and political institutions, or their belief in the legitimacy of the election.The studies analyzed data on Facebook users in the United States from September to December 2020, covering the period during and immediately after the US presidential election.But it has been a rocky path.\u201cSurveys during and at the end of the experiments showed these differences did not translate into measurable effects on users\u2019 attitudes,\u201d Kupferschmidt writes.\u201cAlthough questions about social media\u2019s impact on key political attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors are not fully settled, the experimental findings add to a growing body of research showing there is little evidence that key features of Meta\u2019s platforms alone cause harmful \u2018affective\u2019 polarization or have meaningful effects on these outcomes,\u201d Nick Clegg, the company\u2019s president of global affairs, wrote in a blog post.By themselves, the findings fail to confirm the arguments of Meta\u2019s worst critics, who hold that the company\u2019s products have played a leading role in the polarization of the United States, putting the democracy at risk.That\u2019s according to an accompanying report from Michael W. Wagner, a professor of mass communications at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who served as an independent observer of the studies.Replacing the algorithm with a chronological feed led to people seeing more untrustworthy content (because Meta\u2019s algorithm downranks sources who repeatedly share misinformation), though it cut hateful and intolerant content almost in half.If that\u2019s not true \u2014 as Meta insists it is not \u2014 the company\u2019s best path forward is to enable independent research on that question.I want to end, though, on two criticisms of the research as it has unfolded so far.The company long ago agreed, in principle, to do just that.Meta, for its part, has suggested that the findings show that social networks have only a limited effect on politics.I\u2019ve argued that doing so is ultimately in the company\u2019s interest, as the absence of good research on social networks has bred strong convictions around the world that social networks are harmful to democracy.There are some good reasons for this \u2014 Facebook users have a right to privacy, and regulators will punish the company mightily if it is violated \u2014 but the trade-offs are real.I.Both studies were published in Science.Perhaps, in their totality, we will be able to draw stronger conclusions than we can right now.It\u2019s possible that the most profound effects of social networks on democracy lie somewhere in this mix of factors \u2014 and the studies released today only really gesture at them.(In the Journal\u2019s story, Phelan observed that \u201ccompared to liberals, politically conservative users were far more siloed in their news sources, driven in part by algorithmic processes, and especially apparent on Facebook\u2019s Pages and Groups.\u201d)\n\nPerhaps most importantly, these studies don\u2019t seek to measure how Facebook and other social networks have reshaped our politics more generally.\u201cRather, it is a sign of things to come in the academy: incredible data and research opportunities offered to a select few researchers at the expense of true independence.Two, the findings are consistent with the idea that Facebook represents only one facet of the broader media ecosystem, and most people\u2019s beliefs are informed by a variety of sources.Facebook might have removed \u201cstop the steal\u201d-related content in 2020, for example, but election lies still ran rampant on Fox News, Newsmax, and other sources popular with conservatives.\u201cIndependence by permission is not independent at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne shortcoming of industry\u2013academy collaboration research models more generally, which are reflected in these studies, is that they do not deeply engage with how complicated the data architecture and programming code are at corporations such as Meta,\u201d he wrote.This is\u00a0Platformer, a newsletter on the intersection of Silicon Valley and democracy from Casey Newton and Zo\u00eb Schiffer.Against this somewhat muddled backdrop, it\u2019s no surprise that a fight has broken out around which conclusions we should draw from the studies.\u201cThe findings of the research suggest Meta algorithms are an important part of what is keeping people divided,\u201d she wrote.While researchers struggle to draw definitive conclusions, a few things seem evident.On Thursday, the first research to come out of this work was published.A later project with a nonprofit named Social Science One went nowhere, as Meta took so long to produce data that its biggest backers quit before producing anything of note.Scholarship is not wholly independent when the data are held by for-profit corporations, nor is it independent when those same corporations can limit the nature of what it studied.\u201dEven before 2021, when Frances Haugen rocked the company by releasing thousands of documents detailing its internal research and debates, Meta has faced frequent calls to cooperate with academics on social science.Today let\u2019s talk about some of the most rigorous research we\u2019ve seen to date on the subject of social networks\u2019 influence on politics \u2014 and the predictably intense debate around how to interpret it.\u201cThey also challenge the now commonplace assertion that the ability to reshare content on social media drives polarization.\u201d\n\nBut behind the scenes, as Jeff Horwitz reports at The Wall Street Journal, Meta and the social scientists have been fighting over whether that\u2019s true.(Later it turned out that Meta had accidentally provided researchers with bad data, effectively ruining the research in progress.)Clegg\u2019s comment is \u201cnot the statement we would make.\u201d\n\nScience headlined its package on the studies \u201cWired to Split,\u201d leading to this amazing detail from Horwitz:\u00a0 \u201cRepresentatives of the publication said Meta and outside researchers had asked for a question mark to be added to the title to reflect uncertainty, but that the publication considers its presentation of the research to be fair.\u201d\n\nMeagan Phelan, who worked on the package for Science, wrote to Meta early this week saying that the journal\u2019s findings did not exonerate the social network, Horwitz reported.III.Social media changes how news gets written, how headlines are crafted, how news gets distributed, and how we discuss it.The Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal of 2018, which originated from an academic research partnership, has made Meta understandably anxious about sharing data with social scientists.The rot in our democracy runs much deeper than what you find on Facebook; as I\u2019ve said here before, you can\u2019t solve fascism at the level of tech policy.And despite valid concerns from many of the researchers involved, in the end Meta did grant them most of the independence they were seeking.Wagner found flaws in the process \u2014 more on those in a minute \u2014 but for the most part he found that Meta lived up to its promises.The four studies released today will be followed by 12 more covering the same time period.One problem with this sort of collaboration between academia and industry, he wrote, is that scientists must first know what to ask Meta for \u2014 and often they don\u2019t.Three papers sought to understand how the Facebook news feed affected users\u2019 experiences and beliefs\n\nDespite those setbacks, Meta and researchers have continued to explore new ways of working together.Three papers in Science and one in Nature sought to understand how the contents of the Facebook news feed affected users\u2019 experiences and beliefs.In a third study, published in Nature, the team reduced by one-third the number of posts Facebook users saw from \u201clike-minded\u201d sources\u2014that is, people who share their political leanings.In each of the experiments, the tweaks did change the kind of content users saw: Removing reshared posts made people see far less political news and less news from untrustworthy sources, for instance, but more uncivil content.What to make of all this?Horwitz writes:\n\nThe leaders of the academics, New York University professor Joshua Tucker and University of Texas at Austin professor Talia Stroud, said that while the studies demonstrated that the simple algorithm tweaks didn\u2019t make test subjects less polarized, the papers contained caveats and potential explanations for why such limited alterations conducted in the final months of the 2020 election wouldn\u2019t have changed users\u2019 overall outlook on politics.\u201cThe conclusions of these papers don\u2019t support all of those statements,\u201d said Stroud.Both come from Wagner, who spent more than 500 hours observing the project over more than 350 meetings with researchers.Facebook represents only one facet of the broader media ecosystem\n\nOne, as limited as these studies may seem in their scope, they represent some of the most significant efforts to date for a platform to share data like this with outside researchers.Users in the experiments also ended up spending much less time on the platforms than other users, suggesting they had become less compelling.\u201cSimply put, researchers don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know, and the incentives are not clear for industry partners to reveal everything they know about their platforms.\u201d\n\nThe other key shortcoming, he wrote, is that ultimately this research was done on Meta\u2019s terms, rather than the scientists\u2019.Kai Kupferschmidt summarized the findings in an accompanying piece for Science:\n\nIn one experiment, the researchers prevented Facebook users from seeing any \u201creshared\u201d posts; in another, they displayed Instagram and Facebook feeds to users in reverse chronological order, instead of in an order curated by Meta\u2019s algorithm.They also were no more or less likely to vote in the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nII.But nor do they suggest that altering the feed in ways some lawmakers have called for \u2014 making it chronological rather than ranking posts according to other signals \u2014 would have a positive effect.\u201cIn the end, independence by permission is not independent at all,\u201d Wagner concludes.The good news is that more research is on the way.It\u2019s inarguable that politicians campaign and govern differently now than they did before they could use Facebook and other networks to broadcast their views to the masses.",

this.PreviousNext1/6Reading Mode\u2019s controls are found in your phone\u2019s Accessibility settings.PreviousNext1/6Reading Mode\u2019s controls are found in your phone\u2019s Accessibility settings.When activated, Reading Mode will also disable notifications and other system pop-ups, giving you a brief respite from all of the nags from your phone while reading whatever it is you want to read.Reading Mode was released late last year and is intended to be an accessibility feature \u2014 it makes reading content on your phone easier if you are vision impaired.\u2014 and presents just the text in a modal tab that makes it easy to scroll through and consume.Here\u2019s how to get it all set up:\n\nDownload the Reading Mode app from the Google Play Store.It\u2019s compatible with Android 9 or newer, which should cover the vast majority of devices in use today.PreviousNext1/4The app explains how it works the first time you launch it.PreviousNext1/4The app explains how it works the first time you launch it.It does not bother me in the slightest.)You can use it with content in English, French, Spanish, or Italian.Once the app is installed and you open it, it will walk you through setting it up on your phone.If you tap on the \u201cMore options\u201d link under the shortcut options, you can switch the virtual button to a two-finger swipe-up gesture from the bottom of the screen to enable it.The first time you use Reading Mode, it will walk you through the features and customization.You can customize the typeface, font size, colors, and spacing to fine-tune how it presents the text.You can also opt to launch it by pressing and holding both volume keys.It strips out all of the non-text stuff \u2014 images, links, ads, pop-ups, videos, etc.Tap the play button in the middle to activate the audio playback.By default, Reading Mode is activated by a virtual button that sits on your screen at all times \u2014 tap it, and the app will be activated.Tap above the Reading Mode panel or just swipe down from the top on it, and it will hide, revealing whatever content was underneath.It also can make reading things like recipes on my phone much easier since I can get right to the actual meat of the content.Once installed, there are a few ways to trigger the Reading Mode, but I prefer the two-finger swipe up from the bottom of the screen, which has worked reliably and doesn\u2019t require I have a floating virtual button visible all the time.Most times, I just give up and close the browser, forfeiting knowing about whatever the topic was.This doesn\u2019t fully replace those kinds of services, but for the short articles that I don\u2019t really need to punt until later and I can read right away, it\u2019s great.Of course, much like many other accessibility features, Reading Mode can benefit anyone that uses their phone to read things, which I would venture a guess is everyone that has a phone.(I\u2019m sure there are some of you furiously typing in the comments that you hate The Verge\u2019s design and you use things like this to make it readable for you.To that I say, yes, please keep doing that if it makes it easier for you to read our work.Before discovering this app, I used to send almost every link I encountered on my phone to a read-later service like Pocket that reformats the content into a readable form.It even tells me how long it will take to read a particular article right at the top.The best part is, unlike reading modes that are built into some browsers, the Reading Mode app works on almost anything your phone is displaying, whether that\u2019s in Chrome, an in-app browser, or an app itself.",

            "paraphrased_content": "The ability to convert to a pannier is really the clincher for me: unclip the backpack straps and tuck them away inside an interior flap.I also appreciate the way Peak Design stands behind its products.The material is also incredibly durable, spill-proof, and easy to clean.That love still holds true, especially as I\u2019ve used this travel backpack far more since first writing about it.Peak Design\u2019s anchor connectors are attached to all of my cameras and my keys.$139 at Timbuk2\n\nI asked for the Timbuk2 Custom Prospect Backpack as a gift in 2015 and have been using it ever since.The flocked versions (that fuzzy, velvet-like finish) hold up surprisingly well \u2014 I have one in the shade \u201cblood\u201d that looks almost immaculate despite the near-daily beating it takes.I recently purchased Dagne Dover\u2019s Mara Phone Sling because I needed something simple to stash my phone and keys in when walking my dog or running a quick errand.I got one in lavender, stuck some enamel pins on it, and now there\u2019s absolutely no mistaking this is mine.The main compartment is great for bigger items, and with its included laptop pocket, I\u2019ve never felt the need to get a separate laptop case for my bag.Last year, my older child picked a floral pattern for her smaller version, with her initials embroidered on it in dark pink.$65 at Baboon to the Moon$65 at Urban Outfitters\n\nI\u2019ve always been stymied by the need for a bag smaller than a backpack or knapsack but larger than a dinky clutch.It also has a (not very padded) laptop compartment, some areas on the shoulder straps to add carabiners, and a chest strap that doesn\u2019t seem to ever get in the way when not in use.Its back pocket fits a 13-inch laptop and small tablet.$190 at Amazon$190 at B&H\n\nI finally did it.I was wary of the whole \u201cwear a fanny pack as a mini crossbody bag\u201d trend, but earlier this summer, I caved and bought the Baboon to the Moon 3L Fannypack.The bag has held up through many short and long trips and even a cross-country move.The bags come in a variety of sizes and patterns that fold up into a small pouch, making them the perfect addition to my everyday handbag.At this stage, it\u2019d be an unnecessary hassle to start anew with a different backpack.Tech bag choice fatigue made me buy this\n\nUmar Shakir, news writer\n\nChrome Industries Hondo Backpack$110Functional backpack that takes a 15-inch laptop, with dual water bottle pockets and a water-resistant exterior.$110 at Amazon\n\nWhen you\u2019re into tech, you\u2019ve gotta have the perfect tech bag for every situation.However, I\u2019ve found a daily-use bag that I love just as much.There are plenty of sensible folks in this article who can point you toward genuinely useful (and certainly more palatable) bags to keep your gadgets safe, but I\u2019ll personally remain married to my Killstar Grave Digger Skull handbag until it joins me in my burial plot.However, that bag is a bit large, especially for times when I really don\u2019t need quite as much space, which is why I was delighted when somebody gifted me a smaller version of my bag called the Luna Backpack.I bought the Chrome Semantics Backpack, which, unfortunately, is now discontinued.And at any tech press event or conference, you\u2019re guaranteed to see quite a few of them.Is it practical?Perhaps best of all, there are a ton of customization options available when you order, so you can deck out your bag in whatever style best suits you.One that\u2019s big enough to carry a laptop, my average accessories, and a very selective amount of camera gear.After one of the zippers on my 30L V2 bag started giving me some trouble a few weeks ago, I stopped by the company\u2019s SoHo retail store.I\u2019ve stuck with the Everyday Backpack over the long haul largely out of familiarity; I\u2019ve got my organization system down, and I instinctively know where everything goes among the bag\u2019s many dividers and pockets.But do you really care when you could be pulling your belongings from a colorful ensemble of scalped skulls instead?I recently came into possession of a bag that meets both these qualifications: the Alpha Pannier Backpack by Two Wheel Gear.And once I figured out that I can still fit my Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch into this small-ish backpack by simply adjusting some dividers and packing in one of those handhelds vertically, I knew I had no regrets.This bag really checks a lot of boxes, and it\u2019s easy on the eyes as well.After a couple of weeks of use, I can confidently say that this small bag is worth the price tag.Within 15 minutes, I walked out with a brand new Everyday Backpack free of charge.Suddenly remember you\u2019re out of toilet paper while out?This bag easily fits my wallet, phone, house keys, car keys, hand sanitizer, and chapstick \u2014 everything I need when I take walks or run errands.It\u2019s a laptop bag with a padded pocket for an external battery!The Semantics has mesh pockets on the outside so that even my short arms can reach around and grab items like a water bottle without sliding the bag off my shoulder.The product is incredibly high quality and very durable while also looking a little nicer than most phone slings I\u2019ve come across.They also make wonderful last-minute gift bags!There\u2019s also a selection of colors and finishes to choose from.And the water bottle pockets are handy for carrying around a Hydro Flask or two.It\u2019s a backpack!My younger kid can choose his own pattern when he starts first grade next year, and while he\u2019s welcome to pick the crocodiles or dinosaurs if he really wants to, I hope he picks something he won\u2019t mind still using when he starts middle school because it\u2019s an indestructible workhorse that should last at least that long if not longer.But it\u2019s versatile when I need it to be, and I still love having such quick side access to the main compartment.A bag for the cycling set\n\nAndrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor\n\nAlpha Pannier Backpack$199This backpack works just as well as a pannier for your bike and holds 25 liters of whatever stuff you need to carry.$199 at Amazon$199 at Two Wheel Gear\n\nIf you\u2019re like me and you like to bike most places, you\u2019ll need a bag that\u2019s both versatile and stylish.While it\u2019s taken a little adjustment to get used to a much smaller bag, I\u2019ve made it work and been a little more thoughtful about what I\u2019m carrying on the rare occasions I head into the city to go to our office.And we\u2019re all immensely happy with our purchases.I have a tendency to bring way more gear than I end up really needing, and even though my naive subconscious still tries to pack in a camera and multiple lenses, this version of the Everyday Backpack Zip physically prevents me from going overboard.I can see it easily from a distance, which also makes it harder to lose.A smaller Peak backpack\n\nAntonio Di Benedetto, writer, commerce\n\nPeak Design Everyday Zip 15L$190The Everyday Zip backpack is a compact, multipurpose camera and commuter bag that uses an all-around zipper to open like a capsule, allowing access from the sides or top.With outside pockets on the back and front, a side opening that takes in more stuff than you\u2019d think, and a pocket for a bottle or a small umbrella, my new bag (which I wear over my shoulder more often than I wear it on my back) still carries everything I need but is a lot more discreet for those times when I don\u2019t want to look like I\u2019m leaving on an urban day hike.It\u2019s got one no-gimmicks zipper pocket on the upper back where I carry a multi-device charger and cables, and the interior has two can-sized separators where I can roll up some extra clothes or add a folded pair of headphones in a pouch.A colorful fanny pack\n\nVictoria Song, senior reviewer\n\nBaboon to the Moon Fannypack$65The 3L capacity of this colorful fanny pack, made out of durable Cordura nylon, allows you to easily carry around multiple items.Familiarity counts for a lot with me.(Not to mention trying to figure out if they might suit any kids of our acquaintance for back-to-school purposes.)The ability to show up at your destination without the dreaded back sweat is really priceless.Now, I cannot go back.The top latch fits most rear bike racks.It only came in four colors back then \u2014 red, blue, green, and black \u2014 and so everyone had their initials embroidered on because otherwise, the odds of leaving the language lab with the wrong bag were pretty high.But what I probably like most about this fanny pack (and this brand in general) is how colorful their bags are.Once it does, perhaps this Chrome Hondo bag would be the next closest thing I could get.Baggu Reusable Bags\n\nMakena Kelly, reporter\n\nBaggu reusable bag$14Reusable bag that folds into its own pouch for shopping, workout clothes, or anything that needs to be carried; comes in a variety of patterns.$14 at Baggu\n\nLike almost every other young woman in New York City, I am a Baggu girlie.Not in the slightest \u2014 outside of simply having the space to accommodate a large smartphone, you\u2019ll get absolutely zero features designed specifically to make your life easier.The de facto tech journalist bag keeps pulling me back in\n\nChris Welch, reviewer\n\nPeak Design Everyday Backpack 30L$300The structuring of this bag and the way gear slots into its three shelves and pocket walls with side access offers versatility for those who carry a lot of camera and tech-adjacent gear.$300 at Amazon$300 at B&H\n\nI\u2019ve been lugging Peak Design\u2019s Everyday Backpack around for at least five or six years now.Now that most of us are traveling around again \u2014 to work, to the movies, to friends, or just to get outside and experience the summer \u2014 we are pulling our favorite backpacks and bags from our closets and filling them up with laptops, phones, cameras, clothes, groceries, and other stuff.A completely customized backpack\n\n\u2013Jay Peters, news editor\n\nTimbuk2 Custom Prospect Backpack $139This custom-designed backpack holds a 15-inch laptop, has a spacious interior, and includes a handy flap up top that lets you add a little extra space to the interior of the bag.My choices for a lightweight backpack were so high that I erased all of my research.I\u2019ve written about my desire to have a minimalist backpack that can carry most of my daily cables, chargers, and gadgets, as opposed to a complete-solution one that\u2019s unreasonable to lug around everywhere in New York City.The small front pocket is great for storing little things that I may need easy access to.I specifically chose the 15L size of the Peak Design Everyday Backpack Zip \u2014 as opposed to the massive 30L of the other Peak pack I used to tote around \u2014 to force myself to carry less.Maybe I\u2019ll do that eventually, but for now, I\u2019ve got a new bag to break in.I\u2019ll be very sad once this bag wears out \u2014 it\u2019s already got tears on the mesh pockets from snags.You can even attach your bike helmet using the various straps.I used to say that the company should film a commercial at the main entrance to our building, so many kids with that bag came pouring through every day.If I were to really dive into the hunt for a new bag, I\u2019m sure I could land upon several new contenders that I\u2019d like just as much (or even better).You\u2019ll always have a spare bag tucked away in your primary carry to help you to pack away those goodies.A handbag for clumsy ghouls\n\nJess Weatherbed, news writer\n\nKillstar Grave Digger Skull handbag$85If you want weird, here it is: a handbag in the shape of a skull \u2014 impress your friends!$85 at KillStar$95 at Amazon\n\nOkay, look.Luckily, the build quality is actually impressive for such a gimmicky accessory.Instead, I\u2019ve found a bag that didn\u2019t advertise itself as a tech bag at all and has a couple of features that I really like.My clumsy ass has genuinely dropped this down a flight of concrete stairs, and not only did my iPhone 14 Pro Max come out completely unscathed, but the bag itself only suffered the weeniest of blemishes.I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the most comfortable bag I\u2019ve worn \u2014 especially when it\u2019s nearing maximum capacity and loaded with tech.A sling for daily use\n\nKaitlin Hatton, audience manager\n\nDagne Dover Mara Neoprene Sling Bag$75If all you need to carry with you are the essentials, this is the perfect sling to do it with, made from recycled polyester.$75 at Dagne Dover\n\nI\u2019ve previously written about my love for my inexpensive Lumesner travel backpack in our roundup about travel gear.The Everyday Backpack has a lifetime warranty that actually means something.Here are some of the carry-alls that we here at The Verge have been using.Luckily, there are way more colors to choose from now.I definitely don\u2019t have to schlep school gear anymore \u2014 but I have kids who do.All I\u2019m saying is that two of my friends went out and bought the same bag in different colors as soon as they saw me wearing it.(For my own mental health, please don\u2019t answer that.)It\u2019s a pannier!The size took some getting used to, as the bag really can\u2019t fit much else aside from my phone, but it also keeps me from carrying anything but the essentials.It\u2019s also got a quick-release buckle, so I can stick a carabiner on it and schlepp around a water bottle on hot days.I\u2019ve been using its reusable, collapsible bags for years and don\u2019t see that ending anytime soon.Plus, the waterproof exterior does an admirable job fending off even heavy rain so long as I\u2019ve remembered to close everything up tightly.The inside has some dividers but nothing too complicated.A hard plastic internal shell is what gives the bag its shape as well as provides some protection for its contents.The mix between colorful whimsy and practical functionality is something I wish I saw more often.I started using a more normal-sized backpack.As you will read, most of these have gotten months or even years of good use \u2014 which is what you want in a good backpack or bag.Repeating a classic\n\nKate Cox, senior producer, Decoder\n\nL.L.Bean Deluxe Book Pack $55A favorite for generations, these backpacks will carry everything you (or your kids) need for school.$55 at LL Bean\n\nIt\u2019s been roughly a thousand years since I was in high school, but I remember very clearly that pretty much every kid in my school had the same backpack: the classic L.L.Bean Deluxe Book Pack \u2014 big enough for 40 pounds of textbooks and a crushed lunch.(And no, the employees didn\u2019t know I\u2019m a journalist.)A tapestry backpack\n\nBarbara Krasnoff, reviews editor\n\nDanny K Luna Backpack$54A small stylish backpack made of a tapestry-patterned material with plenty of pockets.$54 at Danny K\n\nIn our previous roundup of The Verge\u2019s favorite backpacks and other bags, I talked about my combination shoulder bag / backpack that was manufactured by a small company called Danny K. Made from a tapestry-like cloth, and full of pockets, zipped and otherwise, this has been my go-to bag for any occasion where I\u2019m not carrying a laptop (which is the only thing that it doesn\u2019t hold).It also helps that I really like the all-around zipper design of this Peak Design bag compared to the separated compartment access of its bigger sibling \u2014 though they\u2019re obviously similar.And if you\u2019re diehard about biking in all weather conditions, the Alpha Pannier Backpack\u2019s waterproof material will certainly impress.It\u2019s been my companion to work, coffee shops, the grocery store, vacations \u2014 so many other places that I can\u2019t remember them all.We\u2019ve covered it regularly at The Verge.Stopping by the grocery store for a few dinner items on your way home from work?",

            "paraphrased_content": "\u201cBut Netflix, to their credit, is always like, \u2018You tell us what you want to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nRipstone has already adapted a Netflix show, but according to Jamie Brayshaw, there\u2019s always the possibility for more.So we have the people now to put towards making the game as good as it can be.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat increased worker power resulted in Oxenfree II being more accessible to people all over the world.Because of the studio\u2019s success with Oxenfree, the acquisition felt like the first indication that Netflix was indeed serious about its gaming venture.\u201cIt really matters to Ripstone to build communities around games people like to play,\u201d he said.\u201cSo I offered for Ripstone to create a brand-new game for The Queen\u2019s Gambit, and the rest is history.\u201d\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Gambit Chess is more than just a straightforward chess game featuring puzzles and other ways to play chess.Netflix supplies its studios with resources, and they\u2019re free to pursue whatever artistic avenue they want.\u201cWe also were able to localize the game into 30 languages, which is insane for a game of our size with about 200,000 words or something like that,\u201d Cannon said.Netflix won\u2019t share how popular its games are, but we\u2019ve seen tiny glimpses behind the curtains.\u201cSo I asked absolutely cheekily, \u2018Could Netflix be the Netflix of games?\u2019 And I was shocked by the response.\u201d\n\nThat cheeky but prescient question got Netflix to open up about its as yet still unannounced plans to bring games to the platform and totally changed Ripstone\u2019s plans for a Queen\u2019s Gambit game.\u201cThe experiences that bring people together, like pool or poker and that sort of stuff, I think there\u2019s definitely a place for that on Netflix.\u201d\n\nThough he stated clearly that there\u2019s nothing to announce currently, it seems like The Queen\u2019s Gambit Chess won\u2019t be the last we see of Ripstone on Netflix.\u201cWe were really kind of wary and nervous before we kind of made the jump into Netflix,\u201d said Adam Hines, lead writer on Oxenfree II and co-founder of Night School Games.Baking Bash.\u201cThe unique thing about partnering with Netflix is that they\u2019re all about learning,\u201d Brayshaw said.Though Bandersnatch had a hot moment, buzz for the \u201cgame\u201d didn\u2019t last terribly long.\u201cThey showed a lot of trust and love and support for us as a partner because they know that we understand chess, and they want to empower us to achieve our creative vision,\u201d Brayshaw said.This approach isn\u2019t too far off from how game subscription services work, bringing Netflix in line with products like Xbox\u2019s Game Pass and Apple Arcade.\u201cBack in October 2020, when The Queen\u2019s Gambit was released, the world fell in love with it,\u201d said Jamie Brayshaw, head of marketing and business development at Ripstone.Netflix doesn\u2019t own this studio, nor did it approach Ripstone \u2014 a company with a history of translating traditional games like poker and chess into video games \u2014 to make The Queen\u2019s Gambit.\u201cThey\u2019re very honest with themselves and with us about this, not knowing what the best course of action is yet,\u201d Hines said.As with Night School, Netflix took a relatively hands-off approach with Ripstone even though it was developing a game based on a Netflix property.According to Hines, Netflix understands that gaming is new, uncharted waters for a streaming platform and that the best way to navigate them is through collaboration.One report from 2022 stated that less than 1 percent of total subscribers play Netflix games.Then, Netflix acquired Night School, makers of Oxenfree and now Oxenfree II: Lost Signals.Indie hits like Into the Breach and Kentucky Route Zero started showing up alongside smaller, Netflix IP-based games like Nailed It!I said, \u2018A lot of people are throwing around the label of the Netflix of games,\u2019\u201d Brayshaw said.In a climate of video game companies getting acquired by larger ones and then either getting absorbed, retooled, or simply shut down, that Night School was able to retain its creative independence is significant.He explained that people were looking for safe ways to engage with others and turned to games to maintain connections with family and friends \u2014 a sentiment Brayshaw and his team wanted to encourage.Night School just released the sequel to Oxenfree, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, to decent acclaim.It wasn\u2019t terribly shocking when Netflix announced it would be adding games to its platform.\u201cSo we\u2019re very open [to the idea].\u201d\n\nNetflix\u2019s gaming strategy seems reminiscent of the platform\u2019s earlier days of throwing around cash for TV and movie projects in hopes of finding what audiences will show up for.Ripstone went to Netflix.\u201cBefore I pitched, I asked the question that kind of changed everything.The Verge spoke to developers from two studios for two wildly different games to get a feel for how gaming is going for Netflix.Though Night School and Ripstone are only a couple of pieces within Netflix\u2019s entire gaming ecosystem, from them, we can glean that Netflix\u2019s gaming philosophy right now resembles a kind of patronage system.Though Netflix won\u2019t share how popular its games are, we can talk to the developers who make them and gain at least some insight into how gaming is going for Netflix.\u201cI think we were around 15 people when we got acquired,\u201d Cannon said.\u201cThey just really want to put some stuff out there and see how fans and their audience respond and make adjustments based on that.\u201dCollaboration seems to be a throughline in Netflix\u2019s gaming philosophy, and it extends beyond its subsidiaries.Ripstone Games is a UK-based developer and maker of the recently released The Queen\u2019s Gambit Chess, which turns the wildly popular chess show into an interactive chess-teaching experience.\u201cFrom a creative perspective, we have been able to maintain our creative independence, which is personally what I care about the most,\u201d he said.\u201cThe number of people playing chess online absolutely skyrocketed.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn addition to The Queen\u2019s Gambit, Brayshaw also credits the covid-19 lockdowns for igniting pop culture\u2019s newfound love of chess.Instead, the news was treated with a mild disinterest.When Ripstone developers went to Netflix with their pitch, they were talking to a licensing team, not a gaming one.Then, when actual games first started rolling out on the platform, they were little more than inconsequential time fillers with names like Shooty Hoops.\u201cThey\u2019re really leaning on us and the studios that they\u2019ve acquired to work with them to figure out how we want to forge ahead in this cool new space of streaming games,\u201d Hines said.From speaking with developers at Ripstone and Night School, there\u2019s a sense that Netflix, two years into this endeavor, is still in the midst of figuring out if gaming is the value add it needs to give it an edge over the Paramount Pluses and Hulus of the world.And for now, the streamer\u2019s partner studios are content to help Netflix figure it out.\u201cIt was definitely a goal when I first started the studio that all of our games and the experiences that we make could be translated into a movie or TV to a comic book or anything else,\u201d Hines said.\u201cSo all of those great ideas that I thought I wanted to pitch didn\u2019t seem like they were the right approach anymore,\u201d Brayshaw said.\u201cGames\u201d on the platform at that point were the \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d style interactive TV shows like Black Mirror: Bandersnatch and Carmen Sandiego: To Steal or Not to Steal.But more than Oxenfree II\u2019s technical improvements and additions, Cannon said the biggest value in having Netflix as a partner is maintaining Night School\u2019s autonomy.\u201cGames like ours, especially chess, filled those needs perfectly, so we reached out to Netflix.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s so interesting about Ripstone\u2019s approach was that, at the time, Netflix\u2019s gaming initiative hadn\u2019t been launched or even announced yet.\u201cBut Netflix, to their credit, is always like, \u2018You tell us what you want to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe relationship between Netflix and its partners works the other way, too, creating a possible future in which Oxenfree or some other Netflix game gets its own show.Game director Bryant Cannon believes that part of the reason for that acclaim is because the game was, in part, developed under Netflix\u2019s eaves.Netflix is also purportedly working on a cloud gaming offering and is in the midst of hiring for an unannounced AAA PC game at its recently founded internal game studio.Image: Ripstone Games / Netflix\n\nBrayshaw said that Netflix and Ripstone had to work together to actualize The Queen\u2019s Gambit Chess.Though Oxenfree II and other games are also distributed on other platforms like the Switch and Xbox, that 1 percent still represents roughly 1.7 million people, which is a lot of eyeballs on games that may not have gotten those eyeballs elsewhere.\u201cThe Oxenfree II team is now about 25\u201330 or so.Image: Night School / Netflix\n\n\u201cTo be perfectly honest, we were always kind of in conversations about if we want to adapt some sort of IP that that\u2019s already out there,\u201d Adam Hines said.Image: Netflix / Night School\n\nNight School was one of the first studios Netflix acquired for its gaming platform.And with Netflix as their patron, there\u2019s also the possibility that these developers\u2019 next projects could be adapting one of the streamer\u2019s many original IPs \u2014 a prospect Night School\u2019s down for, considering it was working on an unannounced Stranger Things project with Telltale Games before its acquisition.Now, in the two years since the Great Netflix Gaming Experiment began, the platform\u2019s gaming offerings encompass an impressive range of genres, complexity, and narrative substance, putting BAFTA winners next to games best suited for commutes and waiting rooms.And it\u2019s long past time to consider Netflix not only a well-established streaming platform but an emerging (and serious) video game publisher.",

            "paraphrased_content": "Nearly unknown to PC and console gamers, anyway, as S-Game had previously found success with the sidescrolling action RPG for mobile Phantom Blade: Executioners (due to launch this year on PC and PlayStation, too).First of all, why did you switch from making mobile games to PC and console?With Unreal Engine 5, we can easily achieve stunning visuals without the need for a large tech team to build the rendering framework from scratch (which is generally the most expensive and high-risk phase in game development).Yes, Lumen allows us to create a gloomy and foggy atmosphere without making it too dark.How many of them are you planning to have in Phantom Blade Zero?How is the multiplayer going to work?Personally, I have been influenced by various cultures.What are the challenges you encountered in switching from mobile to PC and consoles?We cannot yet estimate the exact time of project completion, but we will try to showcase some of the latest achievements during different stages of development.There are many sources of inspiration, including traditional Chinese Wuxia novels, 70s~90s Hong Kong films, Japanese manga such as Vagabond, Berserk, and Claymore.You've said multiplayer dungeons are available after completing the campaign - does that mean the campaign won't be playable in co-op?We hope everyone can continue to follow our progress and stay tuned\uff01\nThank you for your time.Yes,\u00a0we\u00a0will\u00a0do\u00a0our\u00a0best\u00a0to\u00a0make\u00a0the\u00a0controller\u00a0functionality\u00a0applicable\u00a0to\u00a0all\u00a0versions\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0game.However, games developed with Un eal Engine 5 do not possess this feasibility yet.Can you discuss your main inspirations for Phantom Blade Zero?To clarify some key details, we interviewed S-Game Founder and CEO Soulframe Liang.I grew up in China, received professional design education in the United States, and is a zealot of Japanese anime culture.Still, many questions lingered in the minds of fans all across the world.However, I agree that this is still a compromise.Related StoryAlessio PalumboRemnant II Final Q&A \u2013 Gunfire Talks Lore, Combat, Scaling, and MoreThe gameplay intrigued, too, with S-Game claiming inspiration from the Soulslike genre without the same focus on a punishing difficulty.As a reminder, Phantom Blade Zero will be released for PC and PlayStation 5.There were tons of troubles, normally not fun to work with at all.Just think about it \u2013 now, we don't need to worry about how to compensate or refund for in-game payment failures!Yes, we have received great support from AMD and NVidia.Boss battles are definitely the game's highlights, and they are the reason you develop your skill and character.With PC and console games, we have returned to a pure creative domain.Even for the most experienced team, completing a project like this would take several years, not to mention our team are relatively young.The Unreal Engine 5 powered visuals stunned to the point of raising some eyebrows\u00a0 with regards to the feasibility of the graphics for such a small studio.In PBZ, we didn't develop our creation based on any classical Chinese novels, and it's certainly not a style you've seen before.Will that apply to the PC version, too, when using the DualSense controller?In the past, we used to create free-to play, online, mobile games with millions of registrations.Additionally, there are also plenty of secret bosses concealed in the deepest corners of dungeons.However, we hope to pursue the best ways of expression and chase the long-cherished dreams that have been buried for so long.Since the game's development only started in earnest a year and a half ago, is it fair to assume the release is at least two years away?Our game is based on Chinese Wuxia culture, but it is a 100% original fictional world, blending a wide range of cool and dark elements.Our team is actively seeking ways to achieve 4K at 60fps on PS5, or at least a stable 45~50fps, to provide players with the best possible gaming experience.There are a considerable number of unique and distinctive bosses in the game, but the specific quantity cannot be disclosed yet.Only 20% of our energy was spent on actual creativity.Can you talk about the character progression system in Phantom Blade Zero?How will the setting differ from other Chinese fantasy themed games like Black Myth: Wukong, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, or Sword and Fairy?Are you planning to use hardware ray tracing on PS5 and/or PC?Everyone can just jump to gameplay productions.We will design multiplayer experiences for some endgame content.I'd rather keep this information for later.How many weapons are you going to include in the final game?How is UE5 empowering you to create a game of this scope, even with such a small team?Perhaps cloud gaming could help us provide the same experience across all platforms.Unreal Engine 5 is there to enable small teams like us to create large-scale games or, at the very least, significantly reduce the gap between small and large studios.Are boss fights a focus in the game?Moreover, from a market perspective, this actually means a shift from focusing mainly on the domestic market to seeking internationalization.There are no difficulties, only relief.We don't need to figure out how to make the game run on those $100 smartphones or how to minimize the resource package size during the game's loading to reduce churn rate!Nanite enables us to use high-quality assets without impacting the framerate.For our combat system that emphasizes speed, variability, and smoothness, maintaining a stable frame rate while delivering impressive visual effects is crucial.Yes, the story cannot be experienced cooperatively.This nature has allowed me to maintain an open-minded perspective at all times.Will Phantom Blade Zero support both Lumen and Nanite?Instead, we have defined a unique style called \"KungfuPunk,\" which is basically targeting international audiences.More detailed information will also be revealed in the future.Is there a chance for a mobile port of Phantom Blade Zero at some point?Will the PS5 version include different presets (e.g., quality graphics mode, 60FPS performance mode)?The game is essentially an action RPG with rich character progression elements integrated with the storyline and gameplay.Shipping PBZ to mobile devices is indeed an interesting topic.We adopt the most traditional game design approach, avoiding automated mass production.They have provided their own hardware-based ray tracing solutions for both PS5(AMD) and PC.We have a good relationship with Epic China, and they have provided us with a lot of support.Phantom Blade Zero aims much higher regarding production values and scope, though.We have relied on mobile games to develop our player community and accumulated the necessary development experience and resources.Instead, we meticulously handcraft each intense battle, ensuring they are thoughtfully designed and tailored to provide players with a challenging and rewarding experience.Now, we can fully immerse ourselves in perfecting the story, art, and gameplay.A nearly unknown indie developer from China stole the show during the latest PlayStation Showcase with their upcoming game Phantom Blade Zero.Yes, if everything goes as planned, we intend to offer two modes: 2K at 60fps and 4K at 30fps.In terms of games, Ninja Gaiden, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Nioh have also provided me with a lot of inspiration.Isn't it relief?You've said you plan to take advantage of the DualSense's haptics and adaptive triggers.I hope it is a very pure narrative and immersive journey.A lot of weapons to choose from, and they will be presented with some undisclosed game systems.The concept of a killer who betrayed his organization being hunted down by former colleagues is somewhat reminiscent of John Wick.Share this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n Twitter",

            "paraphrased_content": "Multiple sizes are great.In it, she explains how her kids only get two choices of ice cream flavors because having too many flavor options holds up the line and leads to analysis paralysis.If and when it does, the Pro at least has the hardware to support it.Some days, I\u2019d wake up to find that I had the same amount of estimated battery life as the day before.The bottom line is for a weeklong trip or an ultra-long day of workouts, you won\u2019t have to worry about battery life.Unlike other smartwatches with flashlight apps, like the Apple Watch, you can still access other menus and apps.The MIP is slightly easier to read in dimmer settings.That said, I don\u2019t think software-based features (e.g., Hill Score, Endurance Score, more detailed maps, etc.)But going forward, it\u2019d do Garmin a lot of good to pare down the options.You must also create a Garmin Connect account to use the app.By setting up the Garmin Fenix 7S Pro, you\u2019re agreeing to:Garmin\u2019s End User License AgreementGarmin\u2019s Privacy PolicyGarmin\u2019s Security PolicyAll of Garmin\u2019s privacy and legal policies are available within the Garmin Connect app.If you opt for less intense GPS settings or partake in longer outdoor workouts, your battery life could look quite different.In my case, both said I stink at hills and have enough endurance for recreational training.In reality, the Epix Pro\u2019s OLED was plenty bright while outdoors.And it almost goes without saying: there are more metrics in the convoluted Garmin Connect app than you\u2019ll know what to do with.Either way, it far exceeds what you\u2019ll get on an Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro.The Pro watches are the equivalent of an \u201cS\u201d year iPhone.It\u2019s a handy nightlight when I don\u2019t want to wake up my spouse but the cookie jar is calling.That includes things like alarms, timers, notifications, Garmin Pay, and Spotify compatibility.The $899.99 Fenix 7S Pro Sapphire Solar Edition is an excellent multisport watch, but I\u2019m baffled as to why it exists.Conversely, the 7S Pro has a memory-in-pixel display, which has been improved since the standard 7S.Garmin\u2019s Fenix 7S Sapphire Solar makes the case for smaller fitness watches The best Garmin watches for training and everyday life\n\nWhat all of this boils down to is whether you want an OLED display.That said, the Epix Pro has pretty impressive battery life, too, when you consider that always-on OLED displays tend to be power guzzlers.But again, I want to emphasize the Fenix 7S Pro is excellent, and by itself, I have very little to complain about.If you decide to enable Garmin Pay, you\u2019ll also have to agree to the Garmin Pay Terms and Conditions and Garmin Pay Privacy Policy.To activate it, you just have to tap the top left-hand button twice.I have very few complaints about the Fenix 7S Pro aside from the fact that it gets lost in Garmin\u2019s cluttered product catalog.But we\u2019re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate.To use the Garmin Fenix 7S Pro, you must pair it with an iPhone or Android smartphone.It\u2019s also adaptable to different scenarios; the brightness is adjustable, you can program strobe patterns if you get injured during a hike, and you can also opt for a red flashlight at night.In direct sunlight, the Fenix 7S Pro\u2019s MIP display ought to get you superior readability.Exactly the same.That\u2019s impressive.Fenix 7S Pro vs. Epix Pro: do you want OLED?These results were based on my settings and activity levels \u2014 mainly multiband GPS on, and 30-60 minutes of GPS workouts 5-6 days per week.OLED also just elevates the entire experience and feels more modern.This was under a shaded arch.Integrating your Garmin activity data with other services, like Strava, Spotify, or Apple HealthKit, also requires you to agree to those individual terms and policies.Final tally: whatever your phone requires, plus three mandatory Garmin policies and four phone permissions for smart features.With AOD enabled, the Epix Pro gets roughly 3.5 days on a single charge; without it, it gets about 8-9 days.Unless you find a great deal \u2014 as in $200-$300 off \u2014 I recommend the Pro because it gets you the better value.Right now, the Garmin Venu 2 Plus is the only one that is cleared for this purpose, but Garmin says it hopes to one day expand EKG functionality to more watches.I still had to squint quite often when indoors to read the display, and there\u2019s no beating the Epix Pro\u2019s OLED when you\u2019re outside at night.Once again, the flashlight rules\n\nBut what if you\u2019re trying to decide between a standard Fenix 7 and the 7 Pro watches?You\u2019d have to be under the most punishing summer sun to notice much of a difference.For nighttime runs or walks, you can also enable a mode where the light flashes white on your arm\u2019s upswing and red on the downswing, so you\u2019re more visible to cars.It\u2019s bright!You can also opt for a red light at night.Both were comparable in terms of GPS and heart rate accuracy on my runs compared to the Apple Watch Ultra.They\u2019re so similar that I can sum up the difference in a single sentence.It\u2019s supposed to be slightly more readable in low-light conditions, emphasis on slightly.Maybe stick solar charging with extra long battery life on a higher-end Forerunner watch and condense the Fenix and Epix line into one OLED-happy lineup.Solar charging made a negligible impact on weeks where my sun exposure was limited to 30-45 minute morning runs or hour-long walks.Heat acclimation is helpful but one of those metrics that can get buried in the labyrinthian Garmin Connect app.With my bad eyes, I\u2019ll take better readability in all scenarios over a few extra days of battery life.Head-to-head, 7S Pro only makes more sense if you frequently partake in multi-day endurance sports without having to enable any low-power settings.In every scenario, notifications, menus, and widgets were easier to read on the Epix Pro\u2019s OLED.But the Epix Pro now comes in the exact same sizes, so that edge isn\u2019t exactly there anymore.Garmin tends to bring the newest features to older models, and everything the Epix Pro and Fenix 7 Pro have will likely arrive on the regular Fenix 7 (and several other Garmins) this fall.Perfect for raiding the fridge without waking anyone up.They have the same smart features!Both also offer the option of sapphire crystal and titanium for extra durability.But you shouldn\u2019t expect these kinds of results if, like me, you spend most of your time indoors when you\u2019re not on vacation.Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nI get why it\u2019s here now.It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.My 42mm unit lasted roughly 9-11 days on a single charge.Where MIP excels is battery life \u2014 and I can\u2019t deny that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get with the 7S Pro.The updated sensor array has a new optical heart rate sensor and, perhaps one day, EKG capability.(As with the Epix Pro, this flashlight is low-key the best thing about the Fenix 7S Pro.)Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nIn my day-to-day life, the Fenix 7S Pro\u2019s extra battery life didn\u2019t trump the Epix Pro\u2019s OLED display \u2014 at least not at the 42mm size.A real LED light is brighter and more useful than the white screen that typical smartwatches use, too.Additionally, optional safety features like LiveTrack also come with an end-user license agreement.It\u2019s an issue I\u2019ve had with Garmin over the years, but sometimes, there is such a thing as too much choice.There\u2019s very little separating the Fenix 7S Pro and the Epix Pro.You must also grant the Garmin Connect app certain phone permissions for Bluetooth, calendar, location, and notifications.I started the trip with about eight days of battery and ended the trip with five days\u2019 worth.Having a few lines in the lifestyle, midrange, and premium watch categories is also great.Both the 7S Pro and Epix Pro have the new Hill Score and Endurance Score, which tell you how easily you can run up hills or how much endurance you have based on your VO2 Max.And I\u2019m not even factoring in the standard second-gen Epix and Fenix 7 lineups, which are also very similar to the Fenix 7S Pro.I\u2019ve watched too many true crime documentaries to run at night or get stuck in the woods past sundown, but I use the flashlight almost daily.And I cannot overstate this, but the flashlight is probably the best feature Garmin introduced in recent memory.I don\u2019t need to give up a hand to use it.Both were iffy at sleep tracking compared to my Oura Ring as well, though not to the point where it had a noticeably negative impact on training and recovery features.That includes the phone\u2019s terms of service, privacy policy, and any other permissions you grant.All this choice suddenly becomes not-so-great.As far as accuracy, wearability, and fitness tracking go, the experience on both watches was identical.Price-wise, you\u2019re only looking at about $100 in savings by opting for the Fenix 7S Pro.My biggest reason why is every model of the Pro comes with the built-in LED flashlight, whereas it\u2019s limited to the 7X on the standard lineup.There are scenarios where one watch trumps the other, which I\u2019ll get into below.I\u2019m just going to come out and say it.The Epix Pro has an OLED screen; the Fenix 7S Pro has better battery life.Previously, the Fenix 7 lineup had the edge because it came in three sizes, whereas the standard Epix only came in a chunky 47mm size.That said, by the time I tested the 7S Pro, my Hill Score advice did sound less condescending.For these reasons, I recommend the Epix Pro over the 7S Pro for most people.For example, I wore the Fenix 7S Pro during a weeklong trip to Acadia National Park, logging roughly 10-12 hours of direct sunlight on most days.But, generally speaking, there\u2019s not enough of a reason to justify having 34 versions of the same thing.Small wins.I love this thing.RelatedGarmin Epix Pro review: smaller size, bigger appeal (and a flashlight!)Its max brightness matches the flashlight on my iPhone 14 Pro Max.All this reminds me of an Amy Poehler interview I watched ages back.Less is more\n\nIf I sound negative, it\u2019s because my brain hurts from trying to remember all the different permutations of Epix and Fenix watches, their accompanying feature sets, and prices.The fitness features are the same as the Epix Pro.I enjoyed the Morning Report \u2014 which summarizes your overall readiness and sleep, the weather, and gives you a suggested workout \u2014 on the Epix Pro, and that didn\u2019t change when I switched to the 7S Pro.You may also have to agree to share your health data with the company for certain features.8Verge ScoreGarmin Fenix 7S Pro Sapphire Solar Edition$899.99The GoodHands-free flashlight Long battery lifeMultiband GPSUpgraded heart rate sensorThe BadThe improved MIP display still not the easiest to read in dim lightingToo similar to the Epix Pro and standard Fenix 7$900 at Garmin$900 at AmazonHow we rate and review products\n\nAs I wrote in my Epix Pro review, this makes Garmin\u2019s high-end multisport watch lineup more confusing.It\u2019s bright!You can also opt for a red light at night.If you count all the various models and options, that\u2019s 22 versions of the Fenix 7 and 12 versions of the second-gen Epix for a total of 34 watches that are only slightly different from each other.Generally speaking, however, you need to spend a good chunk of the day outside for it to make a noticeable difference.I need Garmin to start doing the same thing \u2014 or at least recognize that the level of choice it's providing far exceeds what people actually need.Agree to continue: Garmin Fenix 7S ProEvery smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads.There are additional policies for optional health insights, contactless payments, and safety features.I use it when I can\u2019t see stuff in my car\u2019s trunk or when I\u2019m rearranging cables under my desk.I just don\u2019t see how having a Fenix, Fenix Pro, Epix, and Epix Pro lineup makes sense in the long run.Solar charging also played a role in this, though it\u2019s hard to quantify exactly how much extra juice you\u2019ll get.But when you end up like Garmin, with 36 different product lines for sale, many of which are iterations on the same thing?It comes in handy when digging through my nightmare closet.You\u2019d still have plenty of choices to choose from, but everything would be more clearly differentiated.You should also keep in mind that battery life is heavily dependent on your individual usage.Perfect for raiding the fridge without waking anyone up.are a pro for the Pro unless you want them right now.Not only did they launch at the same time, but their designs are similar, they both come with Garmin\u2019s upgraded heart rate sensor, they come in the same three sizes (42mm, 47mm, 51mm), and they both have a built-in LED flashlight.To me, the flashlight alone is worth the extra cost, but for the budget-conscious, the standard Fenix 7 can save you $100-$150.I\u2019ve been wearing this watch for the past month, right after roughly a month with the $999.99 Garmin Epix Pro Sapphire Edition.Another reason why the Pro beats the vanilla Fenix 7: it\u2019s more futureproof, with newer sensors and potentially the capability to one day support EKGs.The updates to topographical maps are also the same.As I mentioned, the Fenix 7S Pro has better battery life.They are, in many respects, the same smartwatch, so much that it really feels like I\u2019ve been wearing the same watch for two whole months.",

            "paraphrased_content": "While Apple had always been expected to add $100 to the iPhone 15 Pro pricing, some reports have said that Apple would be eliminating the 128GB storage tier as well.The report comes after several iPhone 15 price predictions have placed the iPhone 15 Pro line at a higher starting point than the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.This new report comes from Tim Long, an analyst at the British bank Barclays, courtesy of MacRumors.Long reportedly cites supply chain companies in Asia and attributes the increased cost of the iPhone to higher quality materials, including the rumored new periscopic telephoto lens.Long believes the regular iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will remain at similar price points, with the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max seeing $100 and up to $200 increases, respectively.According to this analyst, the iPhone 15 lineup could look like this:iPhone 15: $799 / \u00a3849 / AU$1,399\u00a0iPhone 15 Plus: $899 / \u00a3949 / AU$1,579iPhone 15 Pro: \u00a0$1,099 / \u00a31,209 / AU$1,899iPhone 15 Pro Max: $1,099 / \u00a31,209 / AU$1,899\u00a0There are some caveats here.This means that while Apple technically isn't price hiking the base iPhone by $200, for all intents and purposes, it is.Sticker shock strikesApple\u2019s iPhone price raises had been reserved for the top-end iPhones, introducing new and more expensive iPhones rather than raising the floor.To wit, Apple had kept the Pro Max starting price at $1,099 from the iPhone 11 Pro Max for at least four generations of iPhones.Apple is rumored to be raising the price of its upcoming iPhone 15 Pro Max by up to $200.A starting price that\u2019s $200 higher could truly make the best Android phones look more attractive.Even if Samsung edges up its Samsung Galaxy S24 to match Apple at launch, Samsung phones are rarely sold at their recommended retail price, and the proliferation of discounted launch deals makes it easy to grab a Samsung flagship for around 25-40% off.These might be the most expensive big Pro iPhones yet, yet the price trajectory means that they could also be the cheapest big Pro iPhones we\u2019re going to get over the next few years.",

            "paraphrased_content": "As with the firm's retro-styled Emberton 2 (a Bluetooth speaker that looks so good, I ditched my JBL Flip 6 for it), the larger Stanmore Multi-room speaker and Major III headphones to name but a few, the name of the game here is iconic heritage aesthetics married with thoroughly modern innards.It has been released to continue (and celebrate) the legacy of founder Jim Marshall as well as to coincide with what would have been his 100th\u00a0birthday.No \u2013 and it's important to make that point because Marshall amps have been endorsed by some of the world\u2019s most revered artists, including Jimi Hendrix, and all of Marshall's amps are made in Milton Keynes (UK) by skilled craftspeople.Terry Marshall, Jim Marshall\u2019s son and creator of the original JTM45 said: \u201cWhen I was demonstrated the Studio JTM and it took me back to my original JTM45, it was my sound...Marshall\u2019s latest design is inspired by the first ever model made in the brand\u2019s original shop in Hanwell, London.The Studio JTM range will be available to purchase soon on Marshall's website, with prices starting at \u00a3565 / $1480, which is around AU$2,189, but this particular price quote is unofficial.Opinion: I don't even play guitar, but now I want to startI want it and I also want whatever's happening with the decor (Image credit: Marshall)The new Studio JTM range has four unique but equally distinguished products in the form of a 20W head, 20W combo amp, 1 x 12-inch and 2 x 12-inch cabinets all adorned with period-correct aesthetics, such as the famous red enamel poured \u201ccoffin\u201d logo and luxurious fawn fret.The original JTM45, upon which it is based on, was heavily praised by the likes of Gary Moore, Richie Blackmore and Angus Young for granting more tone, more gain and more grit to their sound.And suffice to say, I really like it.Marshall has just introduced the all-new\u00a0Studio JTM amp \u2013 although you'd be forgiven for thinking it's actually been stored in the eaves of a house in Pasadena since 1962 and has only just been rediscovered following a mammoth clear out.Cool.Style over substance?We're right to think that the iconic audio brand is delving directly into its storied past this time around.Its makers promise that the Studio JTM amp is reminiscent of the same sound DNA (think smooth, warm tones) that dates back to the 60s, too.Obviously it's not about to become one of the best Bluetooth speakers we've tested because that's not what it is \u2013\u00a0although for a somewhat similar look, there's always the Orange Box, which is a Bluetooth retro-styled speaker.I mean, look at this thing.I feel like it is going to be something special.\u201dWe should note that the new design is significantly smaller than the original model, but Marshall assures us that the scaling down has been done without compromising on the Marshall sound people know and love.TechRadar doesn't even typically cover musician-specific amps, but here we couldn't resist.",

            "paraphrased_content": "However, while the former still looks set to happen, the latter might not.That's according to reputable leaker Digital Chat Station, who, on Chinese site Weibo (via MacRumors), has claimed that while the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will apparently retain the 48MP camera of their predecessors, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will get a different 48MP camera.Different how?We\u2019ve long expected the iPhone 15 to include two big upgrades over the iPhone 14, specifically a Dynamic Island and the same 48MP main camera as on the iPhone 14 Pro.Digital Chat Station says it'll be a 48MP camera with a 1/1.5-inch sensor, which is smaller than the 1/1.28-inch sensor used by the 48MP camera on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.When it comes to sensors, bigger is betterThat smaller sensor size means it won\u2019t be able to capture as much light, and therefore probably won\u2019t perform as well in low-light conditions.Beyond that, a larger sensor size can benefit depth of field and dynamic range, and can improve the overall image quality \u2013 though in the latter case the size of the sensor is just one of several factors at play.So if Digital Chat Station is right, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus may have less-capable main cameras than the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.We\u2019d take this with a pinch of salt, but this leak doesn\u2019t necessarily conflict with earlier rumors, which tended to simply say that the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus would have a 48MP camera, and didn\u2019t get into the specific sensor sizes.If this claim is correct it\u2019s certainly disappointing, but it\u2019s not all bad news.This would also make for a larger sensor than the 1/1.7-inch one used by the iPhone 14.So this could still be one of the more useful improvements that the iPhone 15 offers over its predecessor \u2013 just not quite as useful as we\u2019d hoped, leaving it less likely to rank among the very best camera phones.A 48MP iPhone 15 camera will still likely be a slight upgrade on the 12MP snapper found on the iPhone 14, even if it doesn\u2019t match the cameras of the Pro models.",

            "paraphrased_content": "We have worked closely with our customers to manage client CPU inventory down to healthy levels as we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives we see a sustained recovery in the second half of the year as inventory has normalized.These chips are due for launch sometime between 2024-2025 and will be making use of several key innovations such as Foveros, 3D chiplets, Power Via, & Backside power routing for higher efficiency inside a completely disaggregated chip design.Intel 7 is done and with the second-half launch of Meteor Lake, Intel 4, our first EUV node is essentially complete with production ramping.With AI Boost, our integrated neural VPU enabling dedicated low-power compute for AI workloads, we will bring AI use cases to life for key experiences people will want and need for hybrid work, productivity, security, and creator capability.Multiple Sierra Forest customers have powered on their boards and silicon is hitting all performance and power targets.Clearwater Forest, the follow-on to Sierra Forest, will come to market in 2025 and be manufactured on Intel 18A.Both next-gen \"2024\" Xeon CPUs with P-Cores & E-Cores are currently going through volume validation across multiple clients who have powered on the first chips on their boards.Intel stated during its recent earnings call that all products and programs are on or ahead of schedule with Arrow Lake already running in Fabs.In addition, backside power improves ease of design, a major benefit not only for our own product but more so even for our foundry customers.Intel's Next-Gen Chips & Processes Are On Track, Company Confirms Arrow Lake CPUs Already Running In Fabs\nIntel's Q2 2023 earnings saw the company return to profitability after several quarters in the red.Seeing a modest recovery in the consumer and education segment as well as strengths in premium segment where we have leadership performance.It was pointed out that Meteor Lake production is ramping up &\u00a0 is on schedule for its launch in the coming months.Meteor Lake will also feature a dedicated AI engine \"Intel AI Boost\".The good news came thanks to major restructuring and the PC market stabilizing once again.We will launch Sierra Forest in first half of 24 with Granite Rapids following shortly thereafter, our lead vehicles for Intel 3.On Intel 20A, our first process node using both RibbonFET and PowerVia, Arrow Lake, our volume client product is currently running its first stepping in the fab.Meteor Lake will be a key inflection point in our client process roadmap as the first platform built on Intel 4, first EUV node, and the first planned chiplet design enabled by Foveros advanced packing technology, delivering improved power efficiency and graphics performance.For the remaining three nodes, I would highlight Intel 3 met defect density and performance milestones in Q2, we reached PVK 1.1 and is on track for overall yields and performance targets.We remain on track for 5 nodes in 5 years and to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025.The silicon is also hitting its projected power and performance targets.Pat Gelsinger (Intel CEO during Q2 23 Earnings Call)\nBuilding on strong demand of our 13th Gen Intel processor family, Meteor Lake is ramping well and in anticipation of a Q3 PRQ, we will maintain and extend our processor leadership and share gains over the last four quarters.Pat Gelsinger (Intel CEO during Q2 23 Earnings Call)\nDuring the call, Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, confirmed that all of their programs were either on or ahead of schedule which means that we can see the upcoming Client and Data Center chips on time.On Intel 18A, we continue to run internal and external chips and we remain on track to be manufacturing-ready by the second half of 2024.Share this story\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n TwitterImportantly, we see the AI PC as a critical inflection point for the PC market over the coming years that will rival the importance of Centrino and WiFi from early 2000s.Pat Gelsinger (Intel CEO during Q2 23 Earnings Call)\nFor the Data Center side of things, Intel once again reaffirmed the launch of three key products, 5th Gen Emerald Rapids in Q4 2023, Sierra Forest with Intel 3 in 1H 2024 & Granite Rapids shortly after that.The company stated that the client business which covers the general PC consumers did better than expected and the company was once again able to gain market share in Q2 while retaining CPU inventories to a healthy level.It's still important for the company to actually launch these chips and we will see if they can deliver on that.Intel also mentioned that its GPU line for HPC, codenamed Falcon Shores, will be targeting the AI space alongside Gaudi 3 by 2024-2025 and the follow-up, Falcon Shores 2, is also anticipated for launch in 2026.Intel already has its first stepping of Arrow Lake chips running in fabs.Moving to products, our client business exceeded expectations and gained share yet again in Q2 as the group executed well.Related StoryRohail SaleemIntel Q2 2023 Earnings: The Company Returns to Profitability\n\nI am pleased to report that all our programs are on or ahead of schedule.Other products mentioned were Intel 18A which is also on track for manufacturing by 2H 2024.The second \"Volume\" client product talked about is Arrow Lake which is the generation that follows Meteor Lake and will be produced in 2024 alongside Lunar Lake CPUs.We remain positive for the long-term outlook for PCs as household density is stable to increasing across multiple regions and usage remains above pre-pandemic levels.For both Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, volume validation with customers is progressing ahead of schedule.Pat Gelsinger (Intel CEO during Q2 23 Earnings Call)\nMost of this is pretty much a recap of what the company has already stated before but its good to hear that all products are still on track and no major changes have been made to the schedule.Our data center CPU roadmap continues to get stronger and remains on or incrementally ahead of schedule with Emerald Rapids, our 5th Gen Xeon Scalable, set to launch in Q4 2023, Sierra Forest, our lead vehicle for Intel 3 will launch in first half of 24, Granite Rapids will follow shortly thereafter.The company is already conducting internal and external chip verifications and tests.In Q2, we announced that we will be the first to implement back-side power delivery silicon 2+ years ahead of the industry enabling power savings, area efficiency, and performance gains for increased compute demand, ideal for use cases like AI, CPUs, and graphics.",

Letters that are not in the answer turn gray\u2026\n4.\u2026BUT the word you guess appears in all quadrants of the puzzle at the same time, so an A could turn green in one square, yellow in another and gray in the final two.But after that, you should select another word or possibly two that use up lots more of the most common consonants and that include any remaining vowels.If not, well good luck!10.Quordle is the only one of the many Wordle clones that I'm still playing now, around 18 months after the daily-word-game craze hit the internet, and with good reason: it's good fun, but also difficult.What's more, its makers (now the online dictionary Merriam-Webster) are also keeping it fresh in the form of a new variant called the Daily Sequence, which sees you complete four puzzles consecutively, rather than concurrently.Use several starting words\nFirstly, you won't want just a single starting word, but almost certainly two or three starting words.He's authored dozens of articles on the game for TechRadar and its sister site Tom's Guide, including a detailed analysis of the most common letters in every position.2.In Wordle, you can instead try several of those in succession and hope one is right, assuming you have enough guesses left.There are two key things to remember.You do not have to include correct letters in subsequent guesses and there is no equivalent of Wordle's Hard mode.Quordle today (game #550) - hint #2 - total vowelsWhat is the total number of vowels in Quordle today?\u2022 The total number of vowels across today's Quordle answers is 8.Quordle today (game #550) - hint #3 - repeated lettersDo any of today's Quordle answers contain repeated letters?\u2022 The number of Quordle answers containing a repeated letter today is 3.Quordle today (game #550) - hint #4 - total lettersHow many different letters are used in Quordle today?\u2022 The total number of different letters used in Quordle today is 12.Quordle today (game #550) - hint #5 - uncommon lettersDo the letters Q, Z, X or J appear in Quordle today?\u2022 No.And rather than complete them in turn, you do so simultaneously.Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green.As with Wordle, the answers are the same for every player each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world.2. Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow.If all goes well, that will give you a good lead on what one or sometimes two of the answers might be.6.
